when i was in my s , i had my first patient ever 
i was a phd student and the studying in berkeley . 
this was a year old woman named alex . 
and when i heard that , i was going . 
and i had a woman in the ' s wanting wanted to talk about boys . 
i 'll the wars , i thought , was do 
but i did to do not . 
 is the new , alex and and , and as far as i did , she had right . 
and , working lot later , later mind married later , children the came later , and the death later . 
but soon i , my adviser important , alex , to in 
i thought against . . 
i said , yeah , you 's encountering the under your grade , she 's going to sleep with a cretin , but she 's 't get married .  
and he was no a big debate before but maybe next dearth is goes on is , the next one 
and the , the best time in alex is to work in she 's married .  
this is what psychologists call a ha moment . 
that was the moment when i realized that it aren not the new . 
alex was to the most time he was at , the moment and and we sat there . 
we 're about about percent of the population , or , if you think that is having going up age adulthood , without even going to age age . 
step back if if you 've in your s . 
oh yeah ! yeah 're all amazing . 
this is not my opinion . these are facts . 
that means that by making decisions , experiences and ha topics that which are alive of your life , what it you , until you 're in the middle , you . 
don 't get if you are over . 
this is going good band of go , i think . 
we know that over half of americans are married to who the future of the age partners or a the future of a relationship . 
we know that the personalities as as the day and things else more often than the fertility of the successfully the fertility rate of women reaching their peak into a life , and that things get complicated difficult . happen 
if we think about development development of a child , we all know that the the first years of developmental to the , that are critical in the brain . 
it 's the time in the average , is comedy mundane , ongoing impact has an ongoing effect on the future . 
but we 're a little bit about , , there 's such like adults , and our primary leap is that it 's a moment of ultimate . 
the press talks about the time difference in the result . getting to 
now call they call it two rate is puberty puberty rate 
that 's right . 
and we we a culture , we 've got it get through this , which is the the critical decade for this age . 
and the essence is that , by long , thing the inspired going to be , get very little , . time is been become underway . 
isn ? 
so what happens is you give somebody to head on their head in the s s and you get years extra to do something on your life ? unnecessary to make a little ? 
and . 
that human being has been denied sense of urgency and and it doesn 't happen . 
or you say , you long as i 've with with years , my started my career is everything is good .  
but later , it sounds to be so close . my ' almost and i have nothing to offer . 
i had a better resume pepsi , when i had graduated college .  
and after this , it was with my s , search for longing engine to jerusalem . 
everybody the them sudden , and the fun and around and then the then the music had would a sudden , and and everyone hanging and they down . 
i didn 't want to be the only ones that stayed standing . i i think sometimes i married my husband , because in was in my s 's s . the next seat .  
that 't do that . 
ok , so is easy , but it doesn 't make a mistake , because it 's very about very lot . 
the post war doesn not a a change winning a a red sports . 
it means that you want the make the career that can , do not 't . 
because notice that you can 't have this child , want , or your can 't give any child . or you can 't give a kid . 
this is a story that shows how it can happening . place way . 
it 's the story of emma . 
emma came in my she was , because she had that , her own like , had instill . her . . 
because that was cheaper , lived with her friend , made his music with his visualizations anguish as his dental . 
and even though their highs were tough , their years ago they 't much worse . 
she had in times in the meetings , but then then rise there and and she 'd say , you can 't pick you family by but your friends already already gone . 
she was almost fascinated if she looked at me , and she said , who will be there for i had a car accident ? 
who will ever me care when i have cancer ?  
it was the moment that i had to hold it , , say not no . 
but emma did 't need a therapist who really cared about her . 
emma needed a better life , and i knew , was her fault . 
in the next weeks weeks , and gave emma girls three to listen for , whether hear if a , woman . 
so i think to at something that would you up . this . 
so something that makes something investment for you is invested in something you you want to be going . 
this new thing this new piece , making new brightest person date date date , we miles is out from the driving from the inner new . 
but the other half is not and poor and faint democracy they 've them to the place . . 
half of jobs of never been in so if your boss to contacted to the idea city of she doesn 't kill a job . 
this 's not a force , so forward word spread to it . 
the last little advice with think emma couldn 't pick up phone , but the friends . 
this was coming up to her , up , but when he would , she was have pick her own family , if she was a partner , he she was a a mom . her own family . 
i said her , the time to search a new family , would . 
you might think that 's better to be down as with , and i 'll to you with you . 
but if any 're having some even effectiveness or live in your life , if everybody gets getting facebook , not progress business . 
the best time to plan your marriage is before you have got a one and which also sense seeking be meaningful purpose in your in your else your is a to find into granny lab participation . 
so your family , i deciding try what you want and and choose you want , and not because it works , or anyone who 's going to be the nearest , who has going adapted to you . 
so what happened to your ? 
we went through her address , and she found the roommate who was working a state working in a museum . 
this weak band helped her to her job there . 
now , five years later , they wrote , set set planner set of museums eastern for museums . 
she brought a guy who asked her . 's 
it 's so easy to help them . 
this applies equally true for , or year a good conversation , a great conversation , a great ted talk , have forward , even years years and and even by framed huge over his tomorrow . 
this is an idea that everyone should supposed to be to know . . 
it 's just simple as i i said to alex . 
don 't tell tell you what you don 't know , or not don 't . 
you 're now now deciding your life right 
thank you . 
but i asked myself , if there was no border at all . 
i imagined that would like this is what 
and first , i developed up with this tool that comes into the digital world , and when you zoom the into into into the screen , it turns the physical sounds . the screen . 
now can practice their ideas as in d and and surgeons can practice more spectacular organs under the screen . 
so with that device , the limit became the by . 
but our hands are still breaking outside the the screen . 
and there windows and dissect overhead space space in the actual space , you can choose it down as easy as you could a book off a page . 
and then you can run the the book and put words in , music , all of the words on the this the virtual airplane beyond window behind every window . each pad . . 
architects , architects can adjust them on their two distances wide wide can . 
so in these two examples , we 're reaching the digital world . 
but what if changing if if we 're all around together and then digital information is happening instead . 
i 'm , of you have already the given buying the articles and for it later . 
but now you don 't need to worry about this . 
what would that a future look like ? 
now , in this case , this round round is like a three dimensional in in our world means that both move move both computer into people the actual that this site all at at least within this small dimension space . 
by making digital digital digitally passionate about we 're driven it from the constraints of space realm by time , using making process human movements now moves be made by the , permanent permanent in world . 
and again , as just as what we have have in computer experimentation to to imagine try to imagine out imagine what programming world of homework changing our daily activities . 
as you marriages sadder norms , digital information is not only show us , but but begin to to to us as part of our physical environment , without us to separate our from our real world . 
today we started talking about the borders , but as we move the limit , the only frontier . our imagination . 
thank you . 
when i was in class , the government wanted to send me to a school to athletes , to send all education , funding . . 
but my mother said , no .  
my parents wanted me to engineer how engineer . she . 
after survived survived the cultural revolution , they found that the only way to get lucky was to safe and safe job . 
it 's not important whether i liked it job or or not . 
but my dream was to become a chinese opera , 
i 'm like i be an oncoming center in my 
but the adults didn 't like my . 
the adults don 't believe it was serious to this . 
only my friends were me out but they were also babies as did as i did . 
and at age , i knew i was too old to start with the training . 
so , dream would never come true . 
i was hoping that i could hope my rest of my life only minute act chance . 
but that 's a way . 
so i had a in my a different calling . 
no one , teach me something also 's not . . 
so i i turned to books books . 
of course , books that banned china china . banned 
 the good world is about the chinese of chinese farmers . 
it 's simply not such propaganda . i understand . 
the bible is interesting , but strange . 
but this 's a theme for another time . 
but the fifth commandment i 'd , to you think , architect of enlightenment , thou shall your father and honor .  
 well thought i thought , this 's the different , and much better than that .  
and , we do is given a lot of insight into 
i example , i found this map that not necessarily put out order first place because because chinese students grew up with this . . 
it never 't make me feel that china doesn 't have to be in the center of the world . 
so a map will a slightly bit about the personal perception . 
the top ratings list your reading is nothing not new . 
in the , in 's a very . . 
and to the if with mind forces with the factor grasp . 
so i i started to two books at the same time . 
when buddha was a psychological grip of nature , fear and social responsibility . 
i in realized , in instance , in happiness in chinese , very translated due joy quick joy .  
books for me , like as magical focus of and i i they have a connection to people 's past and present . 
i know i 'll never going to feel more ugly or powerless . 
i have to believe that it 's not the the only purpose of a mind being realized . 
his most is to bring us to our own objective where things most compelling workforce and where , where our most crucially and our passion . from 
because of i 'm here today , happy , with a purpose in life , and with awareness tort , most of the time . over . . 
you know be books with them . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
when i was years old , a new girl came class came and she was so amazing to be like the new that new girls seemed seem to 
and then i did . 
everyone . 
i gave up everyone the time and even , because was , a , because i also was it time . 
i don 't understand where the idea came about . 
i don 't understand why i 've felt so good . 
i felt really good . 
i don don 't understand why i 've never experienced this . 
it was so clear . 
i was never caught . 
but what thing that blew my , the the alarming surprising , why , the little girl was so good ? the way ? is ? the guise ? 
sensing jealousy was like it sort awe of shock to kept me . 
it 's so very and be so profound , 
we know that babies suffer under stabilized . 
we know that of main of the killing for murder for for men men under the united .s . 
and for need got to turn to the literature , because the novel is the lab that the the sense of jealousy , in of their forms of forms . 
is it an exaggeration to say that if what had damage jealousy sense , do wouldn 't have been ? 
so no achilles of no odyssey . 
no shakespeare sign . 
and jealousy , no law , i know that in fashion , in has fallen in to to state saying , the answer to of all , but in the significance extension has really charge of what really of jealousy criminal extension psyche . 
let think in shallow , we we thinking about feelings . right ? 
we think about the boys who to sleep . 
we forget about refreshing his vision was . 
let 's look at what the novel and the act lock , in corrupted , in lock and the in these so such well . 
is it so obvious that jealousy in the sense that jealousy reduce the behavior , is the that creates strong foundation for a story ? 
and when we are jealous , we tell ourselves story . 
tell ourselves about us about the lives of the rest people and and they do it we 're miserable bad right because because they 're designed to become us bad . 
so the the and the audience is know what what details you have to include , the the knife . the ribs . right ? 
all they 're me and what i really to do to me is could something somebody else also might perhaps even in this moment .  
but you don 't have to worry a too at this it that it 's hard to . right ? 
and jealousy is tedious . 
it 's a trash experience experience that has to be replenished . 
what might the religious penalty ? ? ? 
and jealousy sounded information helpful like 
and jealousy sounded like . 
and jealousy , like photos . 
so the x ray is also so successful . 
and fact fundamentally connects the language of science gives the science and the act of jealousy . 
he might , you might think that this is disgusting , except it 's not a single , to interpret , interpret 's be at a important monument , it to look at a memorial .  
he says , there 's scientific research on worth . force . .  
and what we 're trying to tell is to that the religious evil in seems to look very and but in its heart , it in their essence , it 's a search for knowledge to know that truth , the truth for the the more in the importance , in the the , the greatest state the taller of presidents presidency . the child . 
grief , my loss is for to be the the pool state 
he says a woman who needs need to get our will cherish to our suffering essence broader spectrum relationships continuum of genius as the male , genius , who interests us .  
does he tell us that this for for instance , we we want cruel women ? 
no . i think he 's trying to tell us that what gives us something about us . 
is there another different sense that makes open up to this particular particular ? 
and other sense of our aggression will instill , pride ambition and make urging ? be 
does any other the other sense of being in this look at this unusual intensity ? 
freud should write writing it write about it later . 
one day , freud was people , and they start start start with start , as they would get that he were cheating with wife . 
and freud says , guy , kind strange , he doesn 't even look at what his wife does . 
the poor critter is have a suspicion . 
and she smiling at a man , she with a man with 
freud freud says that the man is the unconscious of the unconscious man his wife .  
the novel is very good at this point . 
the novel involves very very good story about how the bumblebee management submitting was testing our , but not exactly adapted to exactly 
so so i think that in the sense of the , prone 's doing doing not make us to do it . 
and i think about the process of years , but i also think of history story that 've heard in the news . 
for a year . 
she she tried to put it the new girlfriend of new boyfriend in the shoes and and i used trying to sting when when i was it , i was listening to my admiration . 
because . . . let 's be history . 
this is something from a novel . 
this is a way . 
i can 't give up around world 's worth , even if i liked like to do it in some days . 
we all all the citizens of the social media , 's envy founding which economics currency are envy okay ? 
does the see at the roman version down the exit . i i . 
do 's do what the characters do when they 're not when when they 're in a home . 
if 's go to baker , and ask for the . 
that 's the way of thing i 'm really familiar with . 
we 're proud of her .  
and he adds up that there there one in give yards yards a premium , who wouldn failed wouldn 't want to shake hand . 
this is one of the many times that we are training to see training in his stories , and i love this little scene of very it 's also mysterious , very mysterious . but . 
it seems like be as , a , , but it 's to be an amazing problem . 
and the they 're on a wavelength . 
is it so that easy ? 
what if jealousy were really just excruciating problem opposed if it was just what what be , were in other peoples ? 
we could turn ourselves into each other . 
so we 're for it , we still have some literature . to be a of 
we 're in an excellent society . 
thank you . 
it was a beautiful day . 
the forest is the forest . a give us . stand . 
we came coming coming to come up side school . 
i was amazed i be angry , and confused . 
the i question remains and i 'm get to . 
who are we to wake up for us ? 
how do you also turn it or where it 's also be , who are coming out of us in istanbul ? 
who profits drawn to wake up in us in rio , in london , in london ? 
i wanted to meet them as a conscious being . 
i wanted to understand who is the job . 
how is it to a uniform and bringing to wear these ? 
so i started a research project . started in with you . 
i drove along with trucks trucks , the off the interviewed people in interviewed people in offices and in city i the of town , i learned a lot , but i was was a a maverick . 
i had to go even than that . 
so i took a job as a ship . 
i was only drove up with the trucks . i was driving the trucks trucks . 
and i was consuming the mechanical hand and throwing up the snow . 
it was a remarkable privilege privilege , and it was a exciting experience . 
each everybody was asking this smell of after . 
he 's there , but not always you think , and days when where 's really , really , really get really right . 
at 's very gentle to keep used to worry cared . 
i know people who made this job several years of whose their bodies were continue to keep on weight on the , and the own , to each meal of tons , week . 
then there is the . 
you 're all in the all everyday over time , all over messages pages 
all wants to go careful and often not to adjust the car drivers . 
it is really bad for the workers . 
and the trash itself is fully covered by the from and this to cause . and horrible . 
he doesn getting told . 
it 's also a a kind of rubber breathing or the intimidating vessel . 
he has to be motion motion . 
and then there 's the stigma . 
you just the uniform on you make to the things to know angry , and then who 's going angry angry , because you 're blocking the traffic , they stop at their home in or their 're a coffee shop in their housing , or they 're doing lead and say , you want to do a proximity to pass in . 
they are the guardians of public public health . 
disease that we 've had for decades and centuries under were control , would substituting and harming others . 
the economy needs them . 
and then there 's what i mean the average american , typical speed . 
so i 's how way way we 're used to movement forward to this these . 
we don 't care about fix our coffee , our bag or our water or our water bottle , to clean or , or minding follow . . 
we take them , we them , forget , because we know people people are people on the other side concerned taking caring about it 
you see the streets every , regular . 
they 're wearing many cities . 
you know when you can expect them . 
and your 're doing our work . 
they 're like a family . 
and i tried to thank him for his work on day , for i started to . 
and he kind just me , and say would said , well right 's be okay .  
 everything all , it 's going to be a .  
everything 's good . 
but in our effort to changing need going to change the way we 're on this planet as a species , we also have to be pay the that cost , including the very human cost of the work . 
urban urban waste , we think thinking about is about we a percent of for information trash . 
it 's a remarkable figure . 
in your day life , in your life , , if you see someone next 's watching next time , 's a do it , you into up take take a moment , you it 
take , take a moment for say you . 
hello tedwomen , what 's going on ?

because they was in the time 
and dream had come true . 
they were asked perfect people . 
but carve that the , the . 
i don 't like like to call myself the first , but i know she you 've never heard of the things of the bad guys that women are 't funny , and they 're funny screaming . not us . 
our goal was to change the structural of american who the media york city center diamonds in and at blind of slavery in the very time remember that disability south and and the south corruption and not not ending with . 
my big crack big open big , . 
i came in like like the prom exercise , pushing me into a studio , and i me down a chair . 
and she looked at me and said , five , four , three , two . . 
and we were ! live !

in the world wide web , i 'm suddenly filled with my disability . 
 hey , is the nuts walking ?  
does she have disease ? 
we should pray for them .  
it , disability is as visible as the origins . 
if a wheelchair can 't recruit responsive wire , it can also speak wheelchair studios . 
the have disability is the biggest yes . that 's a round . go ahead 
the physicians told me , i can never run , but i 'm sitting here in 
but if would have grown up with social media , i wouldn 't be here . 
maybe there would fewer hatred on the internet , if there were more positive ' models . 
or maybe not . 
maybe it needs a village to be a village to be a child . 
that was the only time that my dad has experienced a live recording of me me , and i would mapped this talk . 
there was a time in we started big big issues . 
on on july th , buzz aldrin got picked on a grumman apollo apollo , went down to the ocean of peace . 
to get to the moon , nasa is about to get about billion dollars according to the worth of , or four percent of the world . 
apollo for jobs jobs created people who did partnerships with , together , universities universities federal and local authorities . 
people died , including the apollo staff 
but up the end of the apollo program , people flew to the moon . 
from the ones that walks up surface was launching , following the of the last year , david the oldest sixth . 
but why did they go ? 
they did 't bring much back an of time of an and something that is be the new very for our common home is a and fragile . 
why did you go ? daddy look , because president kennedy 's at trying to show that his nation had better rockets had . . 
but supposedly , swallow 's stale own word named at from at some 
for apollo years , the only was the victory for the west over the middle of .  of 
and the time , the most feeling was a emotion of the possessed , circle of technology together 
they flew to the moon because it was a great thing . 
the silent was a to a series of a series , triumphs series of sponges . 
from the first half century , the production came in and out line , and the transmissions , and penicillin , and a vaccine against tuberculosis . 
in the middle century , polio and been eradicated and smallpox was eradicated . 
for most of the human history , we couldn 't move faster than a horse or a boat with a sailing , but in , the year the flew able at equivalent months of about five miles a hour . 
since , no have no longer being thrown on the moon . 
i still remember quietly i was standing accident up . 
you all it everywhere . 
we 've heard it here in the last two days at 
it 's not a with most of these things . 
they 've enriched our lives and enriched lives . 
but they 're 't solve the big problems of humanity . 
what happened ? 
but this explanation not a enough . me . 
it explains what 's 'm not accurately to silicon silicon valley . 
no , the reasons , why we 't solve solve big problems , are more profound and profound . 
we sometimes 't have have the problems to fix . 
we could fly to mars if we will . 
nasa even designed a plan already 
but to fly , mars would be a political decision about public policy , and that it 's never happen . 
we 're not going to fly to mars because everybody thinks there 's more important things on need 're to do . 
another time , we can 't solve the the big problems , our political system fail . 
today , less than two percent of the energy consumption in consumption is advanced , renewables , like wind , and wind wind , than percent , is two two percent , and the reason is economically . 
coal and natural gas are wind is cheaper than solar and wind and wind and and is cheaper than call as oil cost . 
but in the current political governance , there is no hope that the energy policy of or the international legislation is will going to receive the opinions and replicate . 
and tiny problems have were come out of the issues but but not so . 
it was seem been that that have famine to just on 
technology things can include products like or systems like nutrient processed for , food , but there 's be considered famine famine strategy according a lack of governance . 
and , the problems of getting problems get the problems solutions , because we don 't get understand the problem . 
difficult trouble problems hard . 
it 's not true that we can 't solve large problems with technology . 
we can , we need to , but we have to have to four elements that the the big and the public have to be interested in the , to interested in solving institutions that need really to really support this problem of technology , we need to understand it . 
it 's not the . 
but , though likelihood thing about the end of that fly to the moon . 
he was only three days away . 
we 're set questioned , and the solutions of the future will becoming more difficult . 
god knows , we doesn 't have don a at do of than

i want to tell you a very bizarre competition that 's been hosting every the york city in year , new york city . 
and so started to realize that for these were in to in just . 
this is crazy . 
and people have to supernatural talents . 
i started talking to some of them . 
i have just a average memory . 
and i thought like , wow , how do i ever more hear more that ?  
 chairman do 've ever spears ?  
i 'm like , what ? why is  
it would prove the world that everybody can be done charge  
i told him , i 'm not actually britney spears actually , but you could teach me . 
i mean , you 've to start somewhere , right ?  
and that was the beginning of a very strange journey to me . 
i didn 't just spend much time in about my memory , but also trying understand and and to how it works and why it doesn sometimes work and what its might be possible 
i met a lot of really people this . 
this is , for example , e ooh the . 
his memory is so bad that it doesn 't even you of themselves airtime . what is amazing . 
so though it was so tragic , he offered offering insights into our memory , to make we are . 
on was , the other side of the spectrum . 
kim . . you know . 
we spent a last in this afternoon in the york in salt york city city . simply really . 
and i 've really a bunch bunch of really interesting things . 
these technologies have enabled our modern world , but at 're transforms changed . same way 
they 've changed our culturally and and i would argue that they 've also changed changes . 
without the need to remember , it seems sometimes we had have how that is going 
in fact , he 's not such unique , there 's significant social problems that this all . 
and that affected me in i the being , i wanted to know how these guys are this . 
they wanted to know , is the structure or anatomy brains different as the rest of us ? 
the answer was , . 
are they smarter than us ? 
it 's like they would using the part of their memory , which is used for the space behavior being able to navigate . 
why ? and can can we learn something that ? 
yeah . 
this baker called the baker baker , chewing called this concept of peculiar nested of which is 'll saying , that if i 'm two guys , remember the same word , remember i tell you to remember 'm , 's a person called the baker .  
this is his name . 
and i tell telling remember remember 's note that 's a person , the baker , the baker .  
now , when i come back to you , i , you know , you know the the said you earlier that i 
you know what word more it ?  
same word memory different memory capacity is strange . 
what 's going on ? ? 
now , the baker baker doesn 't mean you . 
but the baker 's job , we 've known the baker . 
baker incidence also white heroin . 
the baker has on their their hands . 
baker well well , if they smell home from work . 
maybe we even know an a baker . 
one example the touchy technologies for in the ancient , going to be dated ancient 
he was for charge of the conversation , , because when you really wanted to really party , engaged were to dedicated party , you didn not going d .j . 
no can tell who there there old , , to where to do . 
the body cannot be in funded . 
it 's a tragedy after the . 
but i 'll if i was ask you to remember who 's sitting looking on a yellow black in in your hand , portion , imagine could imagine that that 
this is a advice that goes back over the past old age of age about your memory . 
so how does it work ? 
you could go in front of your door . 
imagine a perfectly crazy and illuminating profound story with images lot of time , , looking at to remember you that you would prefer to talk about this about this totally crazy joy . 
and you you go to your house and cookie cookie cookie cookie , cookie the back of mr . ed . ed . 
and that would remind you to introduce your friend ed . 
and then , you 're britney spears , you you pin an anecdote to they they wanted so wanted to tell . 
you go to your kitchen , and the fourth thing you were willing to talk about was this strange trip that went to a year , and you have got some friends to help you remember . remember . 
i just that this stuff quite fascinating , and i 'm even interested amazing . 
i some other emotional retirement risks 
but there was a problem . 
it 's like a group of people who sit there and have test . 
it 's already when somebody is unveiling the temple . 
i 'm a journalist , i need some lessons worth do about which is worth writing . 
so if i was to tell this story , i had to set able to put me in your shoes . 
and so i started , , morning before every single before i was through my sit with my spare , some memorize something 
maybe a poem or a poem . 
the names of an single yearbook that i bought across yard yard sale . 
i had to tell it it was surprisingly fun . 
i could never imagine that . 
it 's been because it 's not about learning your memory . 
i got to push with into . 
i went to the same competition that which i had a year earlier this year earlier . 
the problem was that the experiment didn 't start with 
i won the competition , which would really 't really should have happened . 
that are just tricks . 
so tricks tricks work because they 're working very few simple ideas about how our brain activity ? 
we talk talk about people with memory memory , as if it was a , , but it 's not true . 
we 're more summarized thinking this . 
we remember , we 're involved . 
in fact , these are not even shortcuts . 
they work because they force us to 
they 're forcing us to be and be alert , a way that which we usually 't usually are . 
but these are not shortcuts . 
so things become going to be woven to your memory . 
i 've learned that memory has hints incredible capacity in each of us . 
thank you . 
like any teacher did i i conducted tests and test . . 
i gave up homework . . 
when i came back , i 've little 
and the the first , not did , , not the only difference between the best and the students . 
some of my smartest kids didn 't very well at all cost . 
that made me think . . 
but impossible are not this , , i i was convinced that all of my students could learn the material when their and they were long enough hard enough . 
after the couple more in school , i came to the conclusion that we education , we did a much better understanding of students students do learn from a perspective , motivation , from a psychological perspective , of psychological perspective . 
what we can measure in education is the iq .q . , but what if , in development to life depends on higher dependent than how able to learn and , ability to grade easily ? 
so i left the classroom and and i gave graduate graduate student to work graduate school community 
i started studying children and adults in over the high situation , and wondering , , who is successful and and why is it ? ? why is 
we went to national and we and that predicting we did the kids will ever farthest . 
we partnered making partnerships with various companies and corporations what their crappy cleaners would to 
and those who make money money . 
in all this of different contexts , a feature that as an fundamental of success . 
it were not in intelligence . 
it wasn 't a good look , physical health and and it wasn 't for me .q . 
it was stamina . 
the public is persistence is very benefits term goals . 
the is like a marathon , not sprint . 
some time ago i started training in public school in chicago . 
the scariest difficult subject to this topic is , me , that we know that poorly that science knows so little about how you build it up 
every , every day day , the parents and teachers teachers is , how do we support the stamina of the children ?  
how do i teach kids a solid effect on ? 
the honest answer i don 't know . 
what i know is that there is no stamina to give alone . 
our data is clear that a lot of talented people simply don 't remain their commitment . commitment commitment . 
so far , the best idea i 've heard about the stamina of force grit to become the mindset 's called on is 
and idea has kicked from the stanford university professor at the , and i have learned this the ability to learn to set have be self , , but that change to with their own . 
now , i from i , , higher estimate detailed , kids , if you read reading about the the brain , and learn how how it 's in and growing emerging a much to challenge , , very high more likely you don 't think that failure is a permanent state . 
this this mindset mindset is a great idea for building up . 
but we need more . 
i i want to end my remarks , which is , we . 
this is the work that 's have in . 
we need to test our entryway best concepts and the ordering intuition intuitions and how need to be . 
we have got to measure that we 've . we have to be wrong to fail to to get wrong to learn and lessons and to , and to start . . 
thank you . 
these they 're in emerging economies , which are ethiopia ethiopia , and in in tunisia . 
they also have the possibility that different perspectives of different perspectives , the creation of the architecture world innovated the . . 
this is the kind of building that we 've our team and me , as an example of what we should design , show shown . 
i thought that was to run out . 
after we saw some of the buildings , there were many of them in town city , we realized that they have three main characteristics . 
one , are is almost empty buildings because they 're a high stores where where people can 't afford to buy stuff . 
second second is that they need a lot of energy because the surfaces are out out glass , which is what the inside , and then you need much lot of cooling . 
in a city that should not happen , because they have mild weather , which is quite the to of between 
and third , your image is nothing to do with africa and ethiopia . 
and this is a place place with 's so rich and tradition tradition . a place . 
it has has this idea of public space that which uses the outdoor space to create activity . 
so i thought , that 's exactly what i really want to do , not a mall . 
so we began made a link between these two streets , and we put all all by all building . 
it 's complete be on to a matter broken space space , creates a maker space into in the that will maintain be through own form of its own form and to the . 
and i was , how , how do we fit up making this building ? 
they 've got the characteristics of fractal , the helped me to facade the whole . 
we 'll build this into these little ready , the window machine , the light rate light , the a way , in make constructed . the the light . 
it wasn 't just a they contractor start those effort , the , they they thought , this is not shopping mall . we don 't ordered this .  
and also the concept of the was much , cheaper much less than just material , not just compared of the material , but also because we didn 't need the air . 
so we created made some of the bulk for 've taken to realize that project . 
we made a precious contribution by putting the solar panel on the roof . 
i 'd , the next year , because we 've got the build the construction by to , . frozen . 
the second example is a grand plan a and homes for tunis , tunis . 
so to do such project that was largest significant project that 've ever designed , i had to really understand the city of tunis , but also the environment , the tradition and culture . culture . 
and what this very , this analysis , very survey very subsequent very to start very carefully at the right side and that is the hundredth structure structure that was disconnected by a halfway , was accessible , a glacier , limited , the presence , and through close to , almost through close 
when i was to the site , the first step in the was to prolong able to put the interstate roads to sidewalks ground blocks , with the first blocks , maintain big convenient like and qualities like the barcelona and in other european cities . their agencies . 
in addition , we chose some strategic points out the concept of these devices and connected them with straight lines , and the original pattern egg 
what would the best pressure in a ton of air in a nuclear ? ? 
so we put a pattern in energy in that , most 're sure of the homes are are perfectly aligned towards 
and this 's the result , it 's almost like a european block of a european block the arab city . 
there are the the with the sole and and in electrified they carrying main to the illustrate connections manifestation . 
it also runs the regulations , which bath up higher density into the upper four and a lower density of density in the way . 
it also holds the barrier on the staff . 
the roof , my favorite place on this project , is is almost the community that that is where to take them from built . the construction . 
these , two examples have a shared design . 
they 're in in in where you can see see cities . 
in these cities , the effect of the architecture of today present and the lives of people and regional local communities and economies grow the same way as buildings are building . 
and it 's because i find it a important that architecture is but simple very simple , very the changing environmental significance of community community and the , to the environment that connecting connect people natural to nature nature and to the . 
thank you . 
i want to talk about trust , and i want to remind you of the attention of trust trust assumptions . 
they 're become so ubiquitous that they 've become cliche cliche . clich . 
there think , there is three of me . 
foremost proposition to credit a claim trust very , believe , many . . 
then we need to trust more . 
and one problem we should rebuild . 
i want going to share with you a story about a claim , a key and and really difficult thing that gives you a much better approach to the 's going to offer . 
first , all , the do people have abated to understand that trust has gone down ? 
and when i really think about this grand recent knowledge about i don 't know the answer . 
perhaps in 've have a capacity , you it 's in a other activities . 
i 'm 't have what the secret from 
but i course , i can look at the polls that are allegedly in fact worst , that the belief that the 've come at . 
now at polling polls over time , it 's not a lot of evidence for this . 
and , , were kind to sort ago , was logos were logos the journalists and politicians , still . 
and the the people who have very familiar with this they will 're still very familiar with the month , and . months . 
we 're in between them by by by the way , the average citizens are are almost exactly in the middle . 
but is that a good evidence ? 
opinion polls to read consciously . 
what else would you make about would be 
so you look at the attitudes of the who asked if they ask going to be asking certain questions . 
do they accountable management ? trust you trust them ? 
now , when someone asked someone , do they trust ? 
 well would think exactly what ? ?  
and that would be a reasonable response . 
and if you understand the answer to you might say , i trust some of you , but not .  
that rational . 
and short assessment we try to put in our short life , a very different way , in different ways . 
we don 't really assume that we were going to trust an official public officials or an proof in an official republic or institutional trust . . 
so i could say that that , i a particular company company know writing first class to to to it , but i would 't let you go on school bus a school bus driver 
maybe might maybe don not no making to go a car . 
just . 
so so we know from our everyday life , how different the different and why do we expect collectively how do we fade our knowledge out of trust ? ? 
second second is , let 's move to the goal . 
the goal is to trust more . 
i think i goal is to be dumb . 
that 's not what at that 
 more faith is not a smart priority in this life 
so using utilize self , resources to be the target . 
and then you say , yeah , okay , so 's most important is not trust , but for . 
we can learn gay american 's facts and the . 
and to do that , we need to look at three things . 
are you a ? are you sincere ? are you a ? 
if we determine determine a person in the competent themes , reliably , and , be , we have a good reason to trust their , then trustworthy trustworthy trust them . 
but the person who 's committed , , surely 's probably not . 
some of my friends are competent , , nutrition but would but she would 't submit a because they 're previous . 
i have friends who trust their own competence , but that 's a great deal to do . 
and i 'm very happy about that fact i don 't have a lot of friends who are certified and dependable , but dishonest . 
if if so i haven 't recognized that . 
but after 're only looking for trustworthiness . 
faith is the response . 
we have to do the we have to underestimate that , of course , catastrophic hard . 
many of these systems have the opposite effect on 
they don 't work as a plan . 
a midwife said to me once , , this problem is that the paperwork takes longer than to baby to bring the world to the world .  
all around our public everyday lives , in our institutions , this problem a defining , this control system system , to establish credibility credibility trustworthiness make . 
it 's like person like 's going people midwives from your extraordinarily , by take you to a participant , practicing as 
i 'm sure to patently by going around be sharing , that , for 'm . is do opportunity . 
so much 's really lot closer material the goal . 
the goal is to get more trustworthiness , and that want to be trustworthy and to others , and if we want to , if we not , some be trustworthy , or socially , trustworthy , 
it 's not easy . you have to estimate it . simple response or your to . 
and now for the . 
this as a trust to trust , to looking re draw the mind . 
because it indicates that you should i should restore . 
we can do that in ourselves . 
we can gain a little bit . 
so two people can improve their trust . 
but ultimately the end , it , introducing is accidental to by it 're given to another . 
you can 't build it you people give . 
you have to give them a base to trust . 
so you 've got to be reliable . 
of of course , it 's because you don 't normally touch everybody to touch to engage in the flame . 
but they they have to make mistakes case and they 've trustworthy . 
how do this happen ? 
this happens happening everywhere , regular people do it , officials , i . really , really effective . 
here 's a simple act for concept for 
the store i where i 'll going to buy my , let me bring it back and put them back artists . 
they take them back , they me some money back , or a holes in a bit suit . 
that 's great . i trust you , because they made taken me vulnerable very . 
there 's a big moral issue in it . 
and you you can to the adjust to the you find is 's a very good moral statement , you 're trustworthy , and you can in your own words . 
so our goal is basically not to really identify . 
so the moral of of very , more about trust , or about trusting writers , which are customized from or be customized by or incorrect , and emotionally a both in , and how member trustworthiness , and how an mental evidence for trustworthiness own subjects . 
thank you . 
the film won 't stop properly . 
but when you look at this film role , , you 'll out how extraordinary it is . 
but the magician was different . oz . different . 
he didn not launch that trend . 
it took years , until this trend of , interestingly enough with the movie , a guy from metal and a guy with a whole of fur with a little of micro economics , by rescuing them organs of the vessel . 
you know what i 'm talking about , right ? 
right . 
now , there 's a big of difference lot difference between these two films , even several large differences between the wizard and wizard of oz and all the movies that we 're seeing at today . 
well , of all , there 's a little in little an act of justice in . it . right little force 
the monkeys are pretty aggressive , just like the apple . 
use using your magic lamb , get computers of computers computers of evil by powered brought the west 's to the  
but that is not the . 
i 've this the first time i had my daughter 's daughter 's day , which years later , was the was a situation situation . 
and at that point , i also had a son . 
he was only at years old . a point . 
but he was the second child , and he became pretty much much less comfortable baby his sister . 
and i was myself what he was keeping in . 
did he tell the senior that it loyalty and perseverance and 
did he strict the enemy that luke army army took joining the government to move into government ? 
juxtapose this with the wizard of oz . 
how , how does it actually to parker up to a good ending ? 
this is the kind of world i would rather have thinking kid , would like be oz new , wouldn like would and not in to fight in the world , in the guys with each guys , way we 're rather today . 
there 's a lot of good literature on has the influence of violent films , the movies over all , and these guys should be reading , they 're very good . 
but i have 't read as much about how boys guys deal with this influence . 
i finished my mission , i got the the this girl . 
why are you still there ? 
i don 't know what to do . 
the movies are very aligned , and with get your rewards against the rewards , and there is not a lot of room for others and skills travel to to travel . 
there are plenty of exceptions , and i 'm be to disney up from from everyone else . them . 
but they give giving a message to the young that actually the boys aren 't pose to 
they 're enormously , to be able to help girls girls fight against the patriarchy , but they 're the to boy not necessarily how the eagles who fight against the patriarchy . 
there are no role models for them . 
and the most successful studio of all produced a classic tune after and another , and every single one of them is about a young of a young man , or a husband , or two men , are nine , or a by of and his his man and or , son , or two male who raise a little girls . 
i recommend passionate to encourage you all . he 's on internet the internet . 
 oh , i can 't believe that pixar had a movie . . movie .  
he 's very good . don 't stop the stop it . 
i don 't know if you heard of it . 
he hasn 't really get the right to to do , , but maybe we 're start a a start around 
it 's very . there are only three questions you need to hire . than a character in the movie that and is female , and says something ? 
try to fill the assumption . 
and those these women at to some of at at any point ? 
and is it about their conversation , something else than just the guy they like ? 
you ! we . 
thank you . 
two women who exist and they talk about anything . 
and is what i . i watched seen it , and yet i see see it in the movies that we know about love . 
in fact , i went to the cinema a very good video this well , measured cinema . 
there are some good scenes , now men in this deep sense , who of being , and brought brought up with big moment , the the great of the great athletes to to to a door , peer , and say , you come to the bed .  
so some of talks imagine 
so let 's look a look at the numbers . 
like . 's not a . 
but there 's a number that 's bigger than that , that air going to kick this space . 
last year , the new york times published a study published the government did . 
it , 
one of five five women in the u .s . has already established in their lives . sexually . 
who are these guys ? what are they learning ? 
what do they they learn ? 
do the story of it is a real hero job to come the frustrations 's fight violence , and then they a reward , which is a woman who and pick who have 't have to me 
does do do we take ? this story ? 
you know , as a parent , has the privilege of to raise an daughter , just as the one who do the the we find that same thing , we we get to get this statistics and we want to do it , 
the the bat , the answer , which we can do with very important , and i 'm sharks here in the fathers . 
i think we just have to show our the sons passing , which is a a new definition of masculinity . 
the definition of masculinity is already changing . 
they 's becoming to be hide 
our sons will we 'll find to find a way to adapt , to a a new relationship , each other , and i think we really have to show that that a real man is someone who is your their own , want and want want to compete against their side side , and the really get the guys who are the men who are the men . 
when i asked my daughter , who is your spouse messages in star wars in you know what she said ? 
so , fuzzy angels do . dancing . 
what do these two have in common ? 
maybe it 's not just your palm dress . 
i think these two are are experts . 
these are the two characters in the film that know more than anyone else and and to share knowledge other people to help share experience their potential . 
they 're also leaders . 
i like this kind of task for my daughter and i love this kind of task to my son . 
i want to do more of like this . 
i want like to put a tasks in my son would going to go in and fight a and lot more tasks and more tasks to joining with the team , perhaps , team , perhaps team of teacher by a woman to help other people , better and and to be better people like like the wizard of oz . 
thank you . 
i don 't know his his name is , but the story . that . 
he lives in a small village . somalia . 
his village is in a continuum city . . 
when there was nothing more than what what he was left his , he left his village , went went to the city , in this case , the capital . 
when he hits there , there is no opportunity , no work , no work . 
at the end of the he comes to the camp outside of two dead under under 
it 's maybe a but nothing . 
one one 's being to talk from talk by a man who 's to invite lunch for lunch , to to dinner , to breakfast . 
he 's this dynamic team of young people , and they 's taking him a chance . 
he 's got a little bit of money to on new clothes , and buying money home to his home . 
he 's presented this young woman . 
he brings gets confused . 
he 's a a new life . 
his life has a sense . 
he had been waiting . 
he had stood at for him opportunity to be on the future , and it was the first opportunity he offered him . 
and his story repeats over over time in the around the world . 
often , 's adolescence very who that have suffered from the very unemployment . 
in , there out them will going to be about five people younger the cities than years . 
in my town town the people people who were under under love . 
 have 't have jobs , don 't go to school . 
they actually don 't do anything . 
would i have gotten out on ? 
i 'm not sure what i respond . 
i brought about about young in the east of the world . 
we sat down together and we got a brainstorming solutions for the major of their cities . 
basically home , , a young man . 
he went to grad the university unhappy private school , went with his graduation school . 
there was no jobs , no was no options . 
i remember him like , he was a a school of degree , was was been senior and escaped frustrated , the the perfect target of being be a member of al member and other . 
they were looking people like him . 
but this story takes another run . 
in logical senses are the largest obstacles to to come from a to b is the the the streets . 
it she she 'd had opportunity and she simultaneously . occasion . 
he started to fill and out to ride out rent out , someone else you could not afford to . 
he his family and friends and he 'll he 'll and he dream , dream , he eventually , expand a lot years for the next mix . a hundred . 
how does this story differ different from the other ? 
what does the difference ? 
i think it 's his ability to recognize a new opportunity and use it . 
it encourages a true person who creating the economic opportunity that they 're desperately searching desperately look like desperate . 
you can train boys to be entrepreneurs . 
he helped me to the entrepreneurial business for some young people train train at the top , show them how to innovate and how and entrepreneurship . entrepreneurship . 
so mohamed looked at an opportunity . 
and started birthday for provide guards for flowers , create private gardens , businesses around and he 's been working on the design of the first public parks in years very park of years . . 
there 's no public parks in 
he wants to create a place where families and young people come together , and how , the , the can enjoy the things things about life . 
just so he rolled up the edge he , 't grow a because they need too much water . 
they had never really thought about creating companies business . 
they were they were working for work for an ngo , or for government , but this story , his a powerful influence on them . they them 
he tried to look at her town to a place of opportunity opportunities 
he would to empower able for do that that they could be the to do the change . 
by the end of the day , they had innovative solutions for some of the largest of their city . 
they had such problem set solutions to local problems . 
bring a young people with the resources that need in connect , give them the support that they need to promote ideas and come together and make them real translate to to urban growth . 
it 's about the power of social effects . 
mohamed doesn 't just sell flowers . 
i think he 's selling hope . 
these these young businesses have an impact on their cities . 
thank you . 
but those are hard shells the minds big things find about . . 
they 're from sand in and understanding to see . 
but after a certain period , i had routine routine . 
i started to see forms and and patterns that helped me collect collect them 
and led become to be a passion , maintain things as a deeply with love and a love and archaeology archaeology . 
and that led me to use using satellite imagery . 
i 'm to show you how we look in for example , when we use infrared . 
and the site clearly clearly clearly , brown it we we use infrared , and we edit it with the site , and the wrong of the alphabet , and it tiny will becomes the . 
what you see seeing is the chemical changes of the landscape is through through and and the the ancient egyptians of 
this area is vast area area is four miles the miles . 
and wherever the us did . . test . 
we also found the evidence for a high campaign to which what which shows what it would has have been a very important city . be . 
there is nothing like this in the nation .  
now was 't a b way in bc . 
but it actually started to this way , a .d of and than a long city , where it was itself from , . 
thank you . much . 
thank you . 
i 've had intrigued by this incredible language . which that moment . 
in the last years , i 've been wondering how i i drive down that wall , bring down interested interest has an interest in this complex language , also to sense that understanding value . . 
i thought a new quick to studying , be useful new way , to learn roman . be helpful . 
in the next years years , i have learned to day message frontiers known . 
because just just have only five , a we have a faster , difficult process , we would really be it very , . 
a chinese scholar senses cover about . characters . characters . 
today today 'm going to start with eight characters to show you how the process does . 
ready ? 
open your mouth as you can , square to square . until you 're open 
and it becomes going to become a mouth to it . of it .

do what fire ? 
two flames , hot on

put the fires under two trees , it 's it .

two suns goes . two . 
when the sun and , the moon together , it 's brightness it

this is the sun with the origin because japan , because east china is from china . 
a sun with which origin gentler is japan . 
a human being japan ? this ? 
a japanese . 
today , it , the conventional wisdom has become . 
a mouth that says , where it 's going , stand for a stop . 
this is the slide that reminds me of leaving out the stage . thank you . much . 
she came from a man , a african american , ritual realistic , pretend , butts , homeless , improvising , he was left by a pile , which two rusty . 
nathaniel declined , a breakdown , a a year witness , later lived as the street of skid row by , center in at the center of los angeles . 
he had just heard a demo by beethoven 's first and started the stage in to came to to picture . 
we came talk to the theme of and sometime later few days later , i would get an e where that nathaniel 's up obsessed in pc professor later 
i have mention that nathaniel has a been a medical treatment , because he had been considered , the of electricity and rides thorazine and fiddle , , trauma , a trauma agent had been a whole lifetime . 
he talked about invisible demons and smoke , how someone wanted to poison sleep . a way . 
so i just started to play . 
i played the first sentence from beethoven 's . . 
and while i played , it the , eye , a total change in nathaniel 's notebooks was come real time . 
it was like he was under the influence of a massive medicine , a chemical reaction , a lifestyle was a good . 
and i realized , not only did he have an ancient mind thought music , but with with her own personal relationship with relations well . 
he was talking about her with a passion , a understanding that i 'd ever know my colleagues , the back of los angeles . . 
music is medicine . music is changing us us . 
by struck is emotional health . 
because it music allows him to transform his thoughts and delusions with his imagination , and creativity runs something real , edit 
i realized that this is exactly nature of art . 
and this is the reason why we make music we we do it into all of us , deeply inside our our loop , our artistic , through our artistic lens , through our creative mode , can create shape forms real . 
and the reality that that we all all getting , and moved 's where by 
what people advocated , brought the music brought back into a community of friends . 
thank you . 
bruno giussani thank you . thank you . 
think think robert is contemporary . 
i hope you to me . 
so i 've known in my life we lot of fish . 
i just loved two . 
this first , that was more like a passionate affair of affair affair 
which a fish . 
so you could feel for i could sell him . 
i had a relationship with that beauty over several few of months . 
one day , the head of the company and for asked if i was at a an event to an time , could could be about sustainability from the farm . 
 of course , i said .  .  
here 's a company who was trying to solve what was the for our newly problem for our endemic company . us keeping keeping fish out to 
in the last years , we 've fished reveling the ocean , as 've been through by . 
it 's hard to change the climate . 
there 's almost nothing more . 
that means raising , pounds of soap , so 'll to eat a to eat a pound tuna . 
not very sustainable love 
it is great good either . 
so here was finally company finally was to do it right . 
i wanted them support them . 
so day before the event of , i called the head of the computer . the company . 
call 's call it , knock 's  't call it . 
 don 't don said , only to have the right celebrate , you 're famous for preventing so far in in the ocean that your don 't make the environmentally . widely widely  
 that 's true , he said . we 're so far out from the waste from our fish is not distributed .  
and then he said , we 're basically one a world . 
 the best in the business world  
 . to one , great . 
 . what is your feeding here ?  
 maneuverable fooled the , , he said .  . 
 brilliant , i said . put up . 
and that night i was lay lying in bed , and i thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ? 
so i would up the next day , just before the event , don 't hold . 
i said , don 't you ? like on the proteins ?  
he said he he won 't . he 'll going to know questions . 
now , i got on the phone with a bunch of guys on the company , nobody one told give me an answer to un president , edge , until finally i was going to the front of the vivid 's shore . 
now 's call him a either . . 't 
 don 't you say , what mean , for are real big proteins ?  
i said chicken chicken boots ?  
i said , what , much of of the same mushroom is guaranteed ?  
in the assumption of maybe two percent . 
 well , that 's about percent , he .  . 
i said , don 't you know what what is sustainably to be to dinner eating chicken ?  
there was a long pause there and he said , there 's just too much chicken on the world .  
that 's i what . 
this second fish , which is a story section of love . 
it 's the romantic way that , species way you know that the better you 're the fish , you 're much getting to learn the fish . 
i first dinner first first a restaurant in southern germany . 
and skycar 's been professor about this long time since since that fish . . 
it , gave us . us . 
he came down to the table with a bright white color , , white color . 
whoop a . 
he was still delicious unprecedented delicious . 
i can 't , but this guy can . 
we call it a little bit of . in 's means clay . 
and no , he 's not cooked the ham , and he 's not a chef at least supposed at the way that they understand and i 'm in . 
they engineered this complicated episode of canals , and out dropped water of the water , out the . and out that 
now they you couldn 't do that they work , , not economically . 
and it it it shame day it was a catastrophe . 
it brought about percent of the birds to do what tens were for these places . 
and so , a company has you land . it . 
what did you do ? 
they have the flow of the water around the 
they actually actually touched the the lever . 
your farm is unbelievable . 
i mean , they 've never seen anything like that . 
i was 't long the long time ago with miguel little bit of a . 
and here , he he is at a pattern of steel that reminds him of the minimum , a a . 
i asked him how he get a kind of thing as a know , he get pisces . 
he said , fish ? i don 't know anything about fish . 
i 'm an expert on relationships .  
it 's great , but i fell in love . 
so i 've suspended it off . i said , miguel , how does your fish that 's so good ? your fish ?  
he pointed to the algae . 
 i know boy , the algae , the , the relationships , the relationships , that 's amazing . 
but what 's your fish do you 
now , he 's still to to tell me that it 's such rich a system system , that the fish that they the , what they would eat in the wild . 
the vegetable is , the phytoplankton , the phytoplankton , which is what the the fish . 
there 's no food . 
je farm the farm that you 't feed your animals ? 
i on day , i went riding on this site side and and i said him , i said , for be a place where would which seems of course , would different if from any farm that i 've ever been , , , way that you you 've been measuring ?  
and we see it the the corner and we provided up 's the incredible looking glass thousands and thousands of coral pink , a literally pink looking up that far as the edge . 
 that success is , he said . 
 look at your bellies disk , pink . 
 yeah , he said . 
well last last year on birds this site , birds , more than different species . 
he shook his head . no . 
this is an organic network . 
the flamingos that the fatty liver . 
the shrimp eat feeding the phytoplankton . 
so here 's the fact of the brain , the system the system .  
okay , let 's think this . a farm that doesn 't feed your animals , and a farm that 's measure a hint at your success 's your own throat . 
oh , by by the way , these setting of , at the afternoons place should not be there . 
they breed in a city , miles , , where the surface in more in designed surface mangrove town . 
every morning you fly going to go miles to your . morning . 
and every evening night you flies , miles . 
they do this because they can white white dotted line version the cup a . 
seriously was serious serious . 
i had a kind of trip to the penguins , so so i was watching miguel . 
i said , miguel , you i 'm going to fly you miles miles to to farm and i them back miles ? 
are you doing to do this for the kids ?  
he looked at me , as he just had a song from computer were christmas the whitney biennial . 
he said , no . you do this because the food is better .  
i 'm tell you , i 'll never do it . 
it liked to in as it the bite of like would take a bite from the ocean . 
i 'm this little bit of pulling and he . pulling . pull this little bit . clay across 
he said , skin seems like kill like sponge . 
you 've been the last defense before you 're something in your body . 
okay . farm farm that don 't feed your fish , a farm that assumes going hint success your success on your own . . 
and when it 's fighting the the system , and that leaves our the water that 's sweet there it came going . 
the system is so healthy , cleans the the water . 
so not only serving farm that runs not feeding their animals , not just a farm that 's going to measure out on their health , but a farm that 's leaves a water recycling , and not just for these fish , but for me . 
now what we need now is a radically new concept of agriculture , from a in in fact , to food food really actually taste good for 
but for a lot of people , this 's a little radical . 
and if they say that these are the things the good is good word is given celebrity or and says , hey , i love pink , pink love pink flamingos , like how will they feed the world ? 
how are you going to feed the world ?  
shall i just i going to be honest ? 
i don 't like that question . 
no , not because we 're already going to produce enough calories to feed the world more than percent feeding 
a billion people are becoming a today . 
now , i don 't like those think that this question because you 've had to the logic of our last over two past years . 
so the the reason for was the it was the state policy the , business business agriculture . 
this is not a industry , and it 's not agriculture . 
you you going to consume the world ? 
let 's start with the question how will we going to feed ourselves ? 
or better , how can we create the conditions that enable every to be themselves ? 
and do that , don 't look at the agribusiness model for the future . 
it 's really old , and it 's done . 
let let , let 's look at the green model . 
this is what to being i going the two billion years of work . 
look , miguel , farmers like color . 
because they 're the ones who are also experts who are a of taste . 
and if 'm really honest , you 're a at than i ever ever be . 
you know , that 's a bit thing , tell , because if the 's the future , food it 'll be delicious . 
thank you . 
so the program i 'm using here is a little experiment . 
and right 'm going to see a different pattern , , right that 's what . . 
so if we go on and try and move forward and say say , or or we even even , , we 're that even actually is percent is the leading are to worry worried about . human . 
and if we can make this for raw data , why can content content even ? 
what we 're here is these juvenile every single frequency of reading that had ever printed . 
it 's all here . it 's all online . 
you can try of it after my lecture in in order owned ' s rooms . 
you can diving yourself in one particular year . 
you can jump to a certain edition . 
now , when i look at this , i see the athlete that are in this issue and the 're up . 
i 'm a fan of fan , so i 'm showing to show all what rogers speak content activity which lance armstrong . language taught . 
so i 'm going back to going 'm going to take an views . . 
and so you get an idea that if you hit slide across that kind of information , more googled , very bigger wide , , and in you can 't go come and and remotely and click flat just get . 
you do something that 's actually little bit different . 
it 's something in between and we think that the way information is be used . 
i i want to just this idea forward little bit more on which is a little bit crazy . 
but even in the limited sense , , we can do a lot of things . 
immediately , we 're getting a sense of the themes that are on wikipedia on the very first . . 
it 's just to realize if you take it step back and look at the whole thing . 
i look at a of those babies specific graphs i can put into the same , and i took making people 's the time of , and everyone combined . each other those . . 
and bono , also , ted prize winner . 
so now can jump in watch a ted prize winning all the ted prize . 
we see , we 're surfing on the first the first time as 's even a network , not just to the , but the side . but also much 
and so i want to show you what a a a little surprise of a . 
i 'm just going to show you just the new york times website . 
so i can go back to a step , and i jump up a specific specific unit . 
so so is important because because you can just look through these websites of this sense way , the whole , the whole internet in can a very different way . 
so i can just in in just through my molecular time . 
here 's the state demonstration that i 've on here 
and i can sort of look at everything i 've looked looking at today . come . 
and from here , can go into the site and and then can go to to see to . 
it 's a metaphor that which it 's starting again , and it time it power makes the larger than the data sets off sum of the . 
right now , in this world , we think that data is a curse . 
we are talking about drowning information . 
what if we could turn around situation and and visualize the internet on the head , so of going go from one to another other , begin could start to move getting move from lots of things to lots of stuff , and see aware them that what them what what lines we distant below patterns 
and , instead of just moving into information , we can get knowledge from it . 
and if we learn , then we can actually ruin out we it . 
so i 'll up . thank you . 
i grew up with a school trained school science . . . 
i was in school on school with the bus at school every hour . 
and my nose always always stuck a book called a science fiction that that pony were line my thoughts and dozens thoughts of worlds ignorance and me , strangely and curiosity 
it 's about about trying to understand the world and try the limits of possible . 
and i love of science fiction was seemed to be in my environment , because then in in the late ' s , we flew out to the moon and and the deep ocean . 
jacques rogge came in our living rooms with these fascinating shows that gave giving to us , and a a world of surprising that that we would never have imagined . 
and i was an artist . 
i could draw . i could paint . 
and since there 's no video games to had thrown with video games with the had left whole of the in the mind , the had to create the images in my head . 
we all had to read , the time , when we were reading a book , we took the one of the cage of exposing we projected it on reflect screen , your minds . 
my my reaction to drawing draw and paint and aliens , alien , alien worlds , robots , a part of kind of stuff . 
creativity had to be figure out . 
and something interesting . . me , which was that peter was that jacques cousteau 's in this idea that the that to a completely unfamiliar world here on our own planet . . 
i certainly would never get an alien spaceship to a spaceship , which seemed fairly seemed seemed to be . 
but here was a world that actually actually walk across here , earth , and it was exotic and , and as it the thing that i 'd imagined of when as the the way i 'd read imagined these books . 
so i decided when i was going get divers . 
the only problem with i that was living in a small village in canada , miles from the nearest ocean . 
but the ocean , real ocean , i me years later to be ocean , when we moved to california . 
since now , there years , it are now , i 've spent about two underwater hours of 
until the time i 've in struck awe aspiration opening , what i see on my dives . 
and it 's my my love at the ocean with the same intensity as it did . 
when i was a storyteller of a even i adult , a named , it was the cinema fire . 
and that seemed the best way to tell my inner to be to tell stories with my need to create images . 
as a child , i always always recording cartoons and so . 
so films movies were the way to bring together and stories together fit fit they matched together . 
of course , the stories i was , at of the science , , were firemen films , the , daycare , and i . 
burning 'd try my predilection for the extraneous and connect the with the diving garden . 
so , in 's kind inherently of short short thinking of in of foster passions . 
what what happened was the first computer generated character character full figure kit which had ever been seen in a film . 
now , the film doesn 't bring money , , he was just for his own , but i realized something fascinating fascinating that to audience was like a virtual record , made over from him magic of the magic . 
so they saw something magic . 
and i was what i thought was was so curious . 
and i thought , wow , that 's the i need to be involved in the base .  
so we went to the the the movie , the next film , and more . 
so fully idea of to it would going to skip up with visual printers and so on with fully visual printers , neuroscience tomorrow a way of way . 
and we did too of we managed to do this for a long . for a competitive time advantage . 
but the bar bar back , it nice and the people in my company told that we don 't have feel able to do this . 
so i shifted that and i took this video film over the big ship that 's going to . 
but secretly was i wanted wanted to just the real exhibition of the . in 
so 's why i did the film . 
that is truth truth . the studio didn 't know that . 
i just convinced you , by saying , we 're diving towards the wreck , movies movies movies the paths . 
this is immensely important . it 's a good resource to marketing .  
and i convinced convinced you to give an expedition . 
now , this is crazy . but that , that your imagination to make your own imagination a reality . 
this wasn not a movie , not a high definition , really was really . 
so , this blew my mind . 
and the amount of effort was had to build cameras and build and and and all . . 
you go into into that capsule , and then 're floating boring in this dark , hostile hot environment , where there 's no hope for saving to rescue it , if you don 't own ourselves . 
and i thought , wow , that 's exactly like i was in a science fiction movie . 
this 's very cool .  
i really a really obsessed with exploring the deep sea . 
but so that , of the involved in curiosity and science , it was all , adventure was adventure it it was curiosity . it was imagination . 
and there was an experience that couldn 't give me hollywood . 
because you you know , i could imagine a creature that we then a visual effect , but i couldn 't imagine what i would see outside the window . 
so , was really functional working . and wanted more . 
and so i made a little of a little . 
after the success , i said , well , i 'll to put my filmmaking in hollywood in ice , and i 'll put fruit for full time on time .  
we went to wreck to the titanic . 
no had the level explored the prosthetic of the animal , and we had no means to it . so we developed the technology . . 
i 'm actually using , , just , but my mind is within the recipient synapse . 
because the set was a precise copy of the breakfast for the spinal airplane . 
so this was a very remarkable experience . 
and what made me realize that this telepresence invention that you use to the avatars and the actual self of the it vehicle , in that particular ways , can break down of existence existence . 
it was really profound truly profound profound 
they live with support of support . . 
they 're 't exist in a sunlight based system on our we 're . 
and so you see see animals , right next to a degree centigrade , of that they can survive there 
this was amazing . 
so the circle of circle closed my repeating as a moment of science fiction fan when a child , and the implementation process reality world . and . the the reality of reality . 
so as i went actually this i 've learned a lot about 
i don 't understand much lot of leadership before i get these expeditions . 
because at some point , i had to tell myself what what did i do here ? 
why do i do this ? what does it do out ?  
these stinking movies don 't make us any money . 
we 're going going to play the one . of 's no lane . 
i 've all all these films , these films , for a very small audience . 
no fame , no honor , no money . what do you do ? 
because we 've done all this stuff with way who have been done various comments out sometimes we were been months months months at a row . 
and in that community , you realize that the most important thing is the symbol thing you you have prepared because you have a problem solving struggling with none else you can 't explain otherwise 
it is a link between comes from , respect , 
so when i came back to turn my next spielberg , i tried to do the same kind , and is that you should his team and then were putting respected and the of the with 
and it this really been . dynamics . 
so , again , i was there with a little figure on unknown next , and we turned the , avatar technology a new technology that we going on before . 
so it 's very exciting . 
we have an great challenge . 
and we were given in a half and a half family to to a live woman . 
so this changed my way of doing movies completely . 
so what can we all about all kind 
so , lessons are we learned ? 
i think the position one is curiosity . 
it 's the most powerful human property . 
our imagination is a force that can even create reality . 
and , your team in more important than the of human 's accomplishments . 
i come to see young young filmmaker saying , give me a award of how i can do something like this .  
and i 'm saying to don 't make you one . 
they do going to get people you other people you , don 't do it for , don 't bet to but they risks . you .  
but in art and by , we is needs have to fail an alternative priority , because wherever have have to get a leap argument there . 
no big of endeavor , the innovation innovation innovation , it ever called , 
you must got to be willing to take risks risks of risks . you . 
now that this idea i 'd like to leave you with me journey , is an , an , but fear is not . thank thank you . 
today i 'm going to talk to you about energy and climate . 
but energy and climate are extremely important for these people , even fact , more more important than any else the planet . 
so , climate change become terrible for you . 
so we 're in a wonderful situation with power in the rich world . 
but if we cut down the price we cut our to half half , we 're going to have a new divide , and that barrage of co dioxide is 
co warming the planet , warming and the equation is pretty pretty clear . it co . 
and there are sorry clips of say how bad those outcomes going to follow , but they 're going to be extremely bad . 
i asked the top scientists of scientists , go the top several times , we we get to to zero ? 
isn 't enough enough than half quarter or a quarter ?  
the answer is , to zero , the temperature will going . . 
and it 's a big challenge . 
it 's very little different story to saying say we we have a . foot truck that which has have been cut , feet . them sweaty , you can actually squeeze up underneath . 
this is up to zero , zero . 
now , 're a lot of carbon every over billion tons . 
every , , about , tons of humans people , of poor countries , less than one . 
it 's about , tons of every on the planet . 
and we we need to bring change that will reduce zero . 
it 's continuous . . 
so let 's look at each factor , and time and let 's point measure you how we get this zero . 
probably one of those numbers has very close to zero . 
now this this is algebra , but let 's go it through . 
we first have population population . 
today , billion people . . 
and it turns too to measure it it 's moving to billion people 
the second factor is the service we 're . 
it all all about food that consume , heat , heat . 
it 's great that this number is up . 
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we could probably individuals , and could use less , but actually , but on average , that number will rise up year , and double double than more than double than the the more confident term you will more has grown produced per person . 
here we a very basic service . is it trouble much effort to you to read the homework ? 
well efficiency if , the e , the energy , service , is , is 's good news . 
we have something that doesn not going up . 
in total , if we 're optimistic , perhaps we 're going to get a factor of or even about factor of , factor . 
but for the first three factors , we 've gone went out of billion tons wasted billion tons of and that just simply not out balance . . 
it raises the question if you can get that . 
if you burn the , no . 
if you burn down no no 
so what what we need to do is a global global is create a new system . 
so , when i use the miracle wonder , i don 't mean the impossible . 
the microprocessor is a miracle . the computer .c the computer is a miracle . 
the internet and the has is a miracle . 
people people people here have contributed to a variety of these miracles . 
usually , you 's no deadline that to would a miracle to you be a given date . 
normally you 're just getting to get right and some of , you . 
but this case , we 've to push , and get get a miracle in a very short time . 
now , i was , how can i get get from data ? 
is there any evolutionary place , give us a that people people of people ? ? 
i remembered last year when i had brought some mosquitoes and somehow the people liked it . 
the idea was really it really really transparent , they know that there are people who live with mosquitoes . 
for fell me for and think . this is 
so here 's some natural fireflies . 
i 're me that you won 't bite . they fact , they probably not don even go the glass . 
we need solutions solutions or or we need some have some notions or the only and the only infrastructure , have the problem and and yet there are lots of directions to where people are look for it , i really see one 's five , very great needs of these big options . 
and might actually bringing a paper contribution , and if you 're to to do better , i expect this i point is that , that center point is we we have got to work on all five of them things , , and we can 't give to give it none of them because they 're all and they really problems . 
let 's first look at the burning fossil fuels , burning fuel from from either liver coal or natural gas . 
who 's going to make it it 's going 
who can make a waste of which is literally producing a lot of times greater than any form you trash that you happen arise and nuclear and other things ? 
that is a lot of 
so this is a tough record nut 
what the we going on do next the the next double of fishing . . 
and what do you do with the waste ? 
because even though it 's not that big , there 's a lot of concerns about 
so three very difficult problems that are be solvable , and therefore should be with . 
the the last three of these , put all the last . 
they 're the like they 're often called . other . 
and even though it 's great that you don 't need any you you 've some disadvantages . 
one is the energy density energy these creating brings these technologies is creating as the one consumption . released . 
that is , you 're talking about many , many , times likely , of be a vast run powered generation power regular station . 
and the data dependence is gets center . 's 've got . 
the sun doesn 't seem all day day , it doesn 't seem familiar , and it 's 't go on time and 
that , if you 're going to depend on those sources , you 've got a get a energy too the time , even if you 're not available . get . 
and to point the dimension , i 've assembled all of of batteries that are being by cars , and the cars , cell phones , cell all , its time , and i i what i 've tried with the amount of energy energy , uses the , , which i found that batteries we that 've now created benefited produce store on , a white belt 
so we need a big breakthrough , something that will be better than than the coincidence . 
it 's not impossible , but it 's not that easy . 
if you want to depend up against that , you need an incredible gym . 
so , where should we go , what is the correct approach ? 
manhattan manhattan project ? how do we get to the target ? 
what we need to many lot of companies working on this . hundreds of companies 
we each of areas , we need at least , people 
they 're say , you 're nuts . that is good . 
i think in are a lot of group in the ted group there are already engaged there there . 
nathan myhrvold and i 'd a business to which , , that is a surprise , state , 
so , the progression of this stopped in this industry a while , it it 's not a surprise that some of concepts have been lying a . . 
this is a pretty crazy idea . 
instead of breaking the head down , you just burn it . great thing . 
that 's usually called to slow into a that 's normally , a little bit like a candle . 
you see that it 's a kind of column , often called a cross cross cry 
here 's a picture of a kentucky in kentucky . 
the u the u .s . , hundreds of years . 
you know , there are many challenges , but it 's an example of a examples them concepts of we need to come to . 
let 're going to think about how we should measure our success . 
what should our testimony look like ? 
well , we 's go to the goal , we we 've got to get , and then we 'll about the intermediate steps . 
many people about one nuclear three dimensional percent . 
it 's really important that we 're getting to get there . 
the other note is , whether 're a zero footprint on technology margin of technology , whether it 've developed in all developed developed countries , and we 're on the way to get them to the rest . 
so 's cool , 
if we go back and forth , what should these testimony look like ? 
it should contain the two elements again . 
but actually , the note is the things that 're is not completely the big main area industry just a a second of , or even a important as the other that of represents the tackle of this to 
there are many great books in be topic . 
they really go through and they a framework in which this is wide , , because we need to for sides to help it . 
there are some lot that things must to come together . 
that 's a wish . 
a very intimate very effective purpose wish is have going this technology . 
that has the biggest impact . 
if we don 't get this desire , the average will be associated to be in the global for the long term , in the very term , in the united states and china , between the poor and and almost all those these lives of this billions will be very , very , very bad . 
so what do we need to do ? 
we have to employ more money to more money 
we need to spread the word . 
we need to be more and complete change , and that things that are being to happen undertaken in the government . 
it 's a critically important desire , but i think we can bring him . fill in . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
bill gates taken run the lab to a russian to get all the scientists scientists , which is 've done , we need need a million of and even if we tested our materials in a russian category reactor to make sure that it 's , it 's safe reasonable one in 
once the first is is , if he go going to be like , , , it 'll see everything everything 's all , because the economics energy energy to be so inhibited as be energy much other , we know it . 
bg right right . . have got got to do the ups all ups stuff , so there are lots of people and lots of people , can wrong . and that thing is can make up up and make stuff lighting going . 
but if you have very cheap fuel , you can co it into it in two years , a device , you put it buried without without the permanent placing . 
and it 's sitting there , years seven years , and then it 's done . 
in a waste , even gives you a solution to the . 
bg well , well happens to the garbage you can have it is can put it in the scroll you can take take a lot less garbage and grab it into the next reactor reactor and burn it . 
but as they talking to the whole of they the world , they 've been about these opportunities . 
where 's the biggest interest , what is really consuming ? 
i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and the french have something little bit in a direction . 
this is a nuance of a that has made . 
in your of your time what frame , brain , a what to bring something up to 
and it would be best if you can do it , because then you could use a mix . 
in , we need a solution . 
and big breakthroughs , the big breakthroughs , is this the largest thing you know ? ? 
there are other , ahead gear . 
you know , we don 't know their work in well as these , but there 's actually the modular approach , which is another approach . 
if that doesn 't work , what happens ? 
bg when you get in this situation , it 's like you 've been too much food you , and you 're having a heart attack , right about 're doing ? what do you need ? you need need an operation or a open . . 
you hope we we don 't need that . 
some people say , you don not work work in insurance because perhaps 're doing a physics the insurance , that you 'll going to get out and you , because you know you 're going to save the . 
climate change , have you you have two or two vocabulary to convince you , 
bg well , unfortunately , skeptics , are living in very different camps . 
so people who do arguments argument , they 're not little . 
tell them that 's some negative impacts on the clouds that have to do with the ? 
there are very , very few things you you can even about , of there 's a chance of a million . 
but problem here is much to aids kind . 
you make the mistake now , and you get very lot later on . 
and so the idea here that , , if you 've all sorts already , problems in something which you 've just finished to have in later that to and is that the investment is not clear clear , in actually the worst un policy , is not the case case , , the world , and there are people in are the at the bunk , the world , saying , that , this 's not a great business . 
the fact is that uncertainty uncertainty should is supposed to make about . 
bg well , the actual spending on the for 're saying the u .s . spending saying billion a on they do doing today 's is not as dramatic . 
and there 's the supposed to be suffering other things that are have not suffer . 
you get to very big , , and there are be reasonable reasonable of money people , if you have something that 's not economic , and to pay , , for me , most is what happens here that most . . 
i mean , every one of us here could have five much for our energy without a to change our lifestyle . 
for for the bottom half billion , it 's a disaster . 
his new way is , why don 't the research over channeled anymore ?  
and that 's a association that excuse that i think are proper . 
the research , it 's just crazy how little she government has been supported . 
bill , i think i 'm for all of you people here , when i say , i really hope you wish to come true . thank you very much . 
bg thank you . 
the marshmallow needs to be up the top . 
and even though it seems really , , it 's actually hard really it are getting forward fast . 
and so i thought this is an interesting idea , and i turned it into a workshop . 
it was a real successful success . 
they 's give spend a little bit of time in planning and organization , you know , you 're putting spaghetti . 
they 're investing to spend a lot part of continually the time into the molecular of the technological that 
and finally , just before they don 't have the , someone who takes the marshmallow and then they it gently the tip , and sit back and forth there step and and they admire their work . 
but then , and happens , , however that ta midnight will ooh going oh oh because the weight of the marshmallow causes dropped the whole and evolve down . the whole to 
there are a number of people who ooh know the ooh , ooh , movies they 're the worst commercial graduates are in they 're the lowest maintained business . 
and of course also there , the are also who have much more recent writers there them structures , and in the best , are graduates of of more a most one . 
and that 's pretty amazing . 
as peter said us , not will not only telling the highest towers , also the most original structures of all . 
what you might ask you ask is , why 's coming role ? what about the story 
but there 's another reason . 
and that is research that were trained to go and find the proper plan , ok ! 
and then we 's to realize it 
what happens when they grab the marshmallow on they don no time , what 's going on ? 
it 's a crisis . 
sound familiar , what ? 
and with each attempt , the will get instant feedback which which . 
so the performance is to with prototypes prototype , but we suddenly how different we a team team . 
who 's the most powerful ? 
architects and engineers , for . 
 m . the highest thing i 've seen . 
now ceos know notice , about ceos , but here 's interesting the ceo is happening . 
if have up a law set on the team , you will significantly significantly . . 
it 's incredible . you look , and you 'll see that this team going to win .  
you can predict the future . why do that happen ? 
they 're the process , you understand it . 
and that team that that manages and work will look maintained the effort of effort team effort significantly significantly significant . 
when they have teams that are actions of action action they they have about , of they have the structures . 
i tried something interesting interesting . 
so i got got a prize for the to get this . 
what do she do to do doing this design ? ? 
what was the result ? 
this happened what happened . not a team had built firm . . 
if any had buying build high high construction he would have worn the price for home . 
we reenacted sent doing this same exercise with the same students . 
what what did ? 
now they really began the basis of the cake . 
so this for a same way bad team was one joined the . the best . 
they make the highest level in the world . 
you like ask , why would somebody actually putting time a marshmallow asking 
and what the marshmallow 's , is she 're hiding to hidden assumptions . 
because frankly , each project , his own marshmallow . 
the challenge is together provides a shared in , a common language , or agent actual prototype . 
and this is the value of this experience , this simple exercise . 
it 's a blog where you see how marshmallow is building the marshmallow wars . 
there 's a step by step confidence . 
they 're finding crazy examples from all around the world , people are the system and the charm . 
it demands us all point our senses on the task and that we think we 're using our way in how our 're our feelings and and our we do our feelings , the challenge that 
and sometimes a small prototype of all experience everything that takes us to ooh us , let 's hit up moment . 
and that can make a big difference . 
thank you . 
so do there have a machine . 
a big machine , a cool , like like machine , and that 's a time . 
and everyone in this room has use this 
and you can go into the past , you can go into the future you can 't be in here and you . 
and i wonder myself , you would choose because i 've asked my friends that the last question months times , and they all they wanted them to go into all . 
i don 't know . they wanted to go back to the time before there was cars or twitter to the afghan . 
i don 't know . 
i 'm convinced somehow somehow know somehow sort of called summer , to try to be . 
and i understand that . 
i 'm not part part of this group , i have say . 
i don 't want to go into the past , and because i 'm a adventurers .  
it 's because there 's no way opportunities go back to this planet , they go forward . 
so i 'm to go into this machine , and i want to go to the future . 
there 's never been time time before it we . 
my great grandparents were all dead when they were . 
my grandparents urged these up employees on this one . 
my parents are the to the heels . the iraq . 
but it 's not even about people like us , because this is a than that . 
a child who 's born in new delhi can expect to live as long as the burden man on the planet years ago . 
think about it . that 's an incredible fact . 
and why is that ? 
the . billion people killed on this planet . 
they 've created the projected in a very entirely 's 's kind really able to get . 
they 're gone . they are disappeared away 
in the rich world , the million of us have we existed been under threat , a generation , barely . than . . 
does anyone know what this is ? 
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed , of people , that the by of science process process . 
and from my perspective , the scientific method is to try inquiry , to if it works going to work , it it doesn 't change it 's the greatest for of humanity in humankind spirit . 
so that 's the good news . 
unfortunately , it 've had got the good news , because there 's a couple of other issues , and they 've often mentioned about it 
and one of them is that despite despite all of achievements a billion people in the world to they bed every every day . 
and not just that we 've used our imaginations to make this world a a very literal way . 
so the question is do we do that ? i think . . 
i think it 's clear that we can make food , will feed the billion people without rape land that they live rape . 
i think we can power that to energy that it 're not destroying at the same time . 
i think it 's really , and i , it 's not wishful wishful thinking wishful . 
but this keeps me awake at night , which is me awake at night . we haven had really scientific progress as much 've now . 
so people are taking to go in their faith , and that can 't get get them out of their way . 're . brought 
not even the truth will be be . 
and listen , everyone 's a right opinion on his opinion , even a pretty to progress . 
but you know where you don 't have a right to 
they don 't have a right to their own facts . , they don 't have them . 
and i took a long bit of try this out . 
about a decade ago , i wrote an article about immunization for the new york , a little paper . 
and i was amazed to confront stand resistance to where end of what is the most of job most function of the in the . humankind . 
i didn 't know what to do , so i just did what i was doing , i wrote an article and i wrote an article . 
and i soon a contest on that engineered food yesterday 
same same thing , just . 
people were playing crazy . 
but you you know , i do whatever i do . i wrote the article , i kept on it 
i mean , i 'm a journalist . 
we 're going , we go going to go and eat it 's okay . 
but this articles worried me worried , and i couldn 't figure out why , and eventually , i found it . 
and that 's because these fanatics made me crazy , were 't a 
these were communal politicians aware of people , working people , leadership issues . 
they were just like the people in this room . 
and that kind me so . . . . . 
but then i thought , you know , let ? let 's be honest . 
we 're come to with a point point where we don 't have the same proportion with progress . that . 
we 're talking about this in a , quotes about , progress . 
okay , there there are some reasons , and i think we know what are the reasons that . . 
we have the trust in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science science , itself , and there 's no reason why this should not be . 
you can just call out a couple of names , people will becoming . . 
i mean , you know , you can choose your list . 
there are questions and and there with the people we think were always well . so be they would sort of skeptical . 
ask questions , urge you , you charge charge it . 
take nothing for for effect . 
but now , when you get the evidence , you 've got to get that evidence , and in 're not good at it . 
and i can tell you that , and now is now we 're now going in an epidemic of the , how i 've never seen , and i 'll never see again again . 
very frightening . 
enough were actually of research being done to see if that was true . 
there are a of research to we a serious fund . 
the data came in . 
the data came in from the u .s . , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all equal to none correlation , no connection , no connection , 
it doesn 't matter a difference . it doesn 't make a difference because we think we think in our , we see what we see , what we think creates 're in feeling . in 
but you know what ? 
the result was catastrophic . 
and fact fact of the is is though only countries in the world who are to recommended for . you measles . 
it 's awful . 
what happened is we could do this . 
well , i get this . i do . 
because did anyone eat ? ? 
did one person in the audience ever die somebody die from measles ? 
it don 't often very often . 
this , in this country , it even , but , times , earth in the last year . 
these are a lot of deaths by measles , hour . 
but because this is not happening , we can preach it in and people can hand it get the as the guys upshot questions and guidance platforms and such as watching and watching and larry king live fair . 
and you can do this because they 's a correlation and connection . 
they don 't realize feel that these things seem the , a moment , but they 're almost never . same . 
and this 's something that need to learn , and that 's very quick . 
jonas salk a guitar jonas jonas jonas . 
he was free from remove us from the of the prime illegal death death . 
no fear , no one , a those mating , disappear . 
the guy in the middle not the situation is not that good 
he 's called paul offit .  . 
he can save the lives of . , per year in the developing world . 
pretty good , not 't it ? 
now , that 's good , except from that fact that paul is walking around and saying up vaccines , says , how much 're precious , they that people can should just stop complaining out . 
and he 's what he actually . 
paul paul is a terrorist . 
when paul speaks to a public confirmation , he can 't speak with a guns . 
he gets getting to at home because people will love to tell him that they know where his children go to school . 
and why ? because paul has made a vaccine . 
i don 't need that word but vaccines are essential . 
if you go going , the diseases are going to return the tremendous terrible disease , and that 's happening to . 
we now have measles . around this country . . 
and this gets going worse , and pretty soon , will die again that , because that 's just a matter of numbers numbers . 
and they 're not just to die in oral rehydration therapy . 
what about polio ? do 's say . why not ? 
nobody ever ever said this before . 
they wouldn 't kill a child against prime numbers . no no . 
and . 
why ? because we don not brilliant . and we know what ? 
we had not had off this this country yesterday . 
today , i don 't know , perhaps , someone in a plane in lagos is and and just 's going going to los to los angeles right now . in the moment of ohio . 
and in a few of hours , he lands and pays know and he 's coming , and 's going to go beach , and he 's going to go one of these wal ted ted ted . 
and he doesn 't know that he 's infected with a success disease , and we also 't know , because the 's the the . 
that is the st that live on . you don 't do it 's not . 
we love to lie to us in lying . we love this . 
have you had doing all that have had all your vitamins ? 
i know you did that , half of americans make it every 
they take the stuff , and they take the free meaning , and it doesn 't matter a difference , often we find out they 're ineffective . 
the data sets this that all the time . 
they are their urine . they never do much 
that 's okay , you like billion pay dear dollars for darkened . 
i agree with you . 
dark urine . dark . 
why do we do that ? why do we do that ? 
well , i think we hate the drug industry . 
we hate a strong government . we don 't have the system . 
and we should not waste that . our healthcare care is waste . 
it 's cruel to millions of people . 
so we 're before we get , and where are we go ? 
we 're going the bad off the arms of the placebo industry industry . 
that is great . i love the placebo industry . 
but you know , this is really serious business , because this stuff is crap , and we 're spending billion dollars on this . 
and i 've got all sorts of little props around here . 
and you know what ? if i say that , shout out people , and say , what does it take you ? let people do what they want . 
that 's how good it feel .  
and you know what ? you 're wrong . 
if you move move on that path where belief believe and make certain and provide some magical tool , you 're not to a place where you don 't want to . . 
we 're to oslo rise oslo africa in 
hundreds of thousands of these in in a country that picks even worse than any other ovarian with . 
now , 't tell me these these things don 't have the consequences . 
they have got them they 've always got them . 
this 's a stupid fashion . it has got to stop . 
it 's a debate about words , about metaphors . 
this ideology ideology , not science . 
there were no peripheral . we did all . . 
we 've done it in the last , years . 
and some of it didn and didn 't get some of that . 
we got rid of what didn 't work worked . 
now we can do it . and of course there are risks , but we can do something like supplies a in rice , and the stuff help millions of people , million , people , their their their lives . 
don 't you want to do that ? 
i have to say , i don 't understand that 
we turn mapped a engineered food . 
why do we do this ? 
we don 't want companies to patent . 
we don 't want companies to own seeds own . . 
and you know what my answer to all that ? 
yes , they 're right . we fixed it . 
this has nothing to do with science . 
they know that science is not a business . 
it 's not a country . 
it 's not a an idea . 's a process . 
you know , over the next years we we 'll have percent more food than currently the moment . percent . 
this investment in africa over been years 
they need that , and we don 't give it to them . 
and why ? we have obsolete . we did food . . 
cassava , way , cassava is eating that half billion billion people are . 
it 's about a potato starch . 
it 's just a bunch nest . . it 's too . 
it doesn 't have nutrients nutrients , has no protein , and scientists are building making all into in it . 
and then people could eat this and won won 't be blind . 
they wouldn 't starve , and you know what ? 
that would be beautiful . it wouldn 't be chez panisse , but would be nice . 
and all i can say is is is , why do we fight this ? 
i mean , we ask ourselves , do we fight this ? 
because we don 't want to have any genes the genes around around ? 
it 's not about , genes . it 's not about chemicals . 
it 's not about our ridiculously passionate passion passion for hormones healthy that our larger healthy food , higher food , higher food . 
because you know what ? 
if we don 't do that , if we do to do this , we 'll going about to what something we 're guilty about , i don 't think we guilty , hi be a technology tech ad . 
there 's no other description for what 's going on here 
it 's buddhist selfish , it 's ugly , it 's not worthy , and we need have to stop that . 
so so after this kind of fun entertainment entertainment piece , you might still to say , oh this cooling time machine , forward , go into the future ?  
anyway , that want going to fall at any rate . 
right the moment , is in , but we have an incredible opportunity . 
we can dial this circuits to everything we want . 
we can move forward stage level , where we 're it , and we 're move it forward , where we want to go 
we need to lead these conversations , and we have to think , but when we 're ahead the time machine we into , the future we 're be happy to have this this . 
i know that can , and as far as to do concerned this that this is something that takes the world now . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
i 've been interested in the moment work for the placebo effect , it might seem strange that that a magicians 's about it , because they look it 's as if anyone thinks a there than which you 're about 's enough sense , if somebody 's it bit of interest .  
one of will a wrong be really with somebody perceives how way they 
so so we also get to understand each other , i want going to give you some basic science of basic technology , very is to simple magic trick . 
i 'm explain for for you and then explain it . 
and then i 'll going to explain why i 'll it . 
so , see what happens . 
the knife you can study my hand that you can study . 
i 'm just going to hold the knife in my hand . 
i my sleeve back . 
and to make sure that nothing in my sleeve disappear , i of him , i 'll just going to draw my head right here . 
and the goal is very simple . 
i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully , if everything goes well , it knife is detained by my physical physical magnetism joint . 
it actually actually so deep in his place , that i can all it , the knife . 
ta there ! 
probably you 're know a this room here this point . 
this is how the 's working like the 
i think the knife in my hand . 
the reason i was holding my wrist is because it actual secret is that is 
and in the moment , where i mean my my hand from you eyes , showing it from the back , this this fingers , just simply , simply being there where where he drowned is , resting , a position that he so oblivious the back . 
amazing trick ? 
sitting in the back , somebody who had no childhood . 
so , he 's right here . 
and as i leave change the , just opening of going his position . 
and now you could talk about why this is a deception , why you don 't realize that there are only three fingers and the mind and the way that 's processed processing not the conscious one , two , three , three , one see them as a group . 
but that 's not really the thing at all , and then i open my hand . 
i 'm taking that off . and here 's the knife . 
this this trick can greeting share to your friends and neighbors . thank you . 
now what does that do to do with placebo placebo effect ? 
a read a study a year ago , and i did a study that really rocked my mind . 
i 'm not a doctor or a researcher , and so that was the amazing thing to me . 
but if you shape change the shape , which you 're putting it against for 're doing placebo bit placebo into a smaller pill , and then those color rate coherent letters on it , in 's actually mastered effective . 
and even though it 's no one stuff . pharmaceutical . . 's just pollen . 
but a white pill is it 's not as good as a evidenced pill . 
what ? i got really freaking out . 
but it turns out that this is still not all . 
if you take these toys , more heavy effective than the any blades discovered of the situation . 
a wedding capsule , which is in the end , a yellow capsule red and on the other red is it 's better than a white capsule capsule capsule . 
and patients also play a role . 
a pill now five hours a half a pills more day is not as good as three pills i can 't remember the statistics audience of the statistics . 
but key but is , . . 
and the shape really . 
and if you want want to have the ultimate placebo effect , you have to grab the needle . 
the ? inconvenience of the had an rebellious a suffer with some of the most important substance that you just sharing to suffer a patient work 
this creates a very powerful image in head head , that 's much stronger than a white pill . 
this graph is is . . i i 'm going to show you another time showing show you a slide . code . we have a slide . . . 
so the fact that the white pill doesn 't seem well as well as the blue pill that done worked as well as a capsule as a capsule that which so good needle is working as well the 
and none of it has has any interest pharmaceutical type , it 's our our faith in it made made stronger effect . 
i wanted to know if i could use this kind trick . a virtuoso . . 
i 'm something that 's obviously deception , and i actually real . 
we know from that study that you have to grab the the needle when you 's to settle to action . . 
this is my skin . this is not a special effect from hollywood . 
i 'm going to grab those needle into my skin and push pull it it , until they hit bursting the the other side of it . 
if you 're referring if you just just the very , i just sampled found the dog 's last night in baghdad i 've 't know , and i some little 's and i hadn been had presented . 
so i 'm going that if if they get getting evil bit bit , you at the next seconds seconds , or , you know what , i 'm going to make the first step of here . 
you can see it in a second . but you can see even later if if you like to . away . 
so , it goes this this right here , where my flesh starts , at the lower depths of my arm i just get a small piece of open arm play of candy . 
does 'm really sorry . does that fall you crazy ? 
and just a little bit through my skin and all the other side , it 's out . 
about , . 
but now you can 't count my hands . can ? 
so , i 'm show you . this 's one , two , three , four , five . 
well , 
i know what people are when they see this . 
well , i 'll show you . 
what 's this look like ? pretty good . 
yeah , i know . 
and people go in like , okay . i don 't seen that right .  
let me show you right little . . 
this is really skin . this is not a special of effect from hollywood . 
that is my meat , and i can flip the rotten . 
i . if you get evil , look this , don 't look away 
the back , the the people who would later that later on later on video will , will 'll say , well , this look that looks impressive impressive , but if it was real , he if it were real , you would see there is a hole standing , and it really really , , it .  
yeah , here it is . 
i would pick just out the needle typically . 
i would clean my arm , , and show them there were no a . 
but i think in this context and and with think on to make something intention of making a that because , i 'm just going to let the needle in there just go into the stage . 
we 're going to meet another couple of . . the next few days . 
i hope you appreciate looking looking it . thank you very 
everybody talks talking today the today . 
i have had some people counting leave the number of books , were been published the records last published dramatically last of the last five years , and they spent it after . and there was been more . that . 
there 's an tremendous wave of concern in association work among 
there are openings . high camps . 
everybody would love to make people people . 
but despite all of rain , there are several cognitive lands , so are sort of impossible to think about happiness . 
and my talk today is mostly to cause mainly the mainly cognitive cognitive activity . 
it turns out that the word happiness simply isn 't a word word anymore because we 're using it to lots of different things . 
i think there 's a certain meaning that could just focus it , , but in the big and , , , we 're going to have up , and we 're going to take to take a little view at it to what it . 
the second assumption that is is a life of memory is really it 's basically his life and his life , and happy to live about his life or happy happy with his . happy lives his life . 
and these are two very different concepts , and they 're both in the point of happiness . 
and the concentration is the illusion , and that unhappy one fact , that recognizing we can 't think about a fixed of how to being affects the well being in without significance . 
i mean , that is a real cognitive error . 
there 's doesn 't have any way to getting the right way 
and then he said , really quite emotional , which 's ruined the whole experience . 
but that didn 't . 
what it ruined ruined the the memories of 
he had the the . 
he had a dominant music for a minutes s . 
what really tells us is that we could think about ourselves and about about other people in the sense of two types of self . 
or how how , what how know , after to albania ? like something this . 
and this really really really a fundamental fundamental response to our memories of it immediately . 
we 're not only telling stories when we make things to 
our memory is telling us , what we 're supposed to keep with with experiences is a story . 
there 's an old study . 
these is real real patient who a painful process . 
i 'm not going to the details , it 's not longer painful , but she was painful when when this study was done in the s s . 
they were asked to cover everyone in their s second . 
and here are two patients . these are their records . 
and you 're asked , is suffered from from both ?  
and that is a very simple question . 
but now , there 's another question how much these this patients think they had suffering ?  
and here 's a surprise . 
and no of those stories are very studied , good but one of them is this clearly . . 
but one of them is terribly worse than the other . 
and the , which is worse , was deep of time time at the very highest was its peak . it 's a terrible terrible story . 
how do we know this 
this 's going to cause in patient 's suffering has , but only a little bit and than less than before . 
what what does this story that is us ? 
and that is true of the stories that holds deliver in and our and it 's true of the stories we invent . 
and what happens means is it 's and story , it it profound part , profound subject a moments . 
so 's very , very important , and important , in this case , the end story 
it 's a quotes of silence , one by another . 
and ask ask , what happens with these moments ? 
and the answer is really simple . they 've lost forever . 
i mean most of our lives , and of our moments , life , and i have they know that psychology psychological presence of about three seconds , about three seconds , , which means that there in a , there are a million of them in a month . which are about , people people people of which that are leave 't seem even daily . 
and they they a sense , you think the idea that they count what happens while these moments of time is our lives . 
it 's a finite resource that consume while we 're on this world . 
the biggest difference between them is a time . 
they didn not changed history . 
we don 't actually choose between between , we we vote memories of 
and even if we think about the future , we don about our future , as usually 't usually think of ourselves experiences . 
and that 's a little hard duty justify , i . 
i mean , how are we burning out the of our memories ? 
and when i think about it , i think about a vacation that , 've made a few years ago in the , clearly the best vacations that i had ever had , and i think had about it , has to how many other people think of the other areas . 
now , if i had open the manila folder , i would have spent another half hour . 
well , that 's three weeks , and that 's exactly hours time . 
there seems to be a disagreement . 
now , i might a bit extreme an extreme extreme , you know , like little i dioxide flames i what i 've got on the experience of your , but even if they do more of it , there 's a real question . why do we give out so lot of the ingredient encompasses that what that the weigh , we birth ? we give ? 
so i want you to think about a thought experiment . 
now , what you choose the pet vacation ? 
why we pick the foster we which we we we 're , is a problem that and that gives what we us to choice of of the two choices . 
now , the two species of throwing some things from happiness . for happiness . 
there are actually two concepts of happiness that we can begin , one per a . 
and they 're all kind impressive moments moments . a fairly complicated process . 
which are the emotion that are be measured by the 
it 's not about how happy a person lives . 
it 's about happy 's positive or peaceful person is 's engaged in this person is life is about their lives . 
very different of importantly . 
so who is not different from being words that being done to child educational of happiness , and i 'm involved in a lot of researchers in succeeds fostered teaching and study of happiness and time in that way of practice . 
the gallup survey has had a on the world at over which over than half half million people have been asked about what they think about their lives and their experiences , and there were other efforts going a direction . 
so in the last years , we 've begun to learn the happiness of both of species of own . 
and the principal lesson we 've learned , i think , are that they 're really different . 
you can know how someone is satisfied with his life , and the teaches them not much about how happy he lives and vice versa 
just to give you an idea of the correlation , is correlation with you . 
what does means is that if you were to meet someone and and you would say , oh , his dad is a two foot of man how much would you know about his size of 
well , you would know something his size , but there 's a lot of uncertainty . 
they have so much uncertainty . 
so the correlation is low . 
we know something what keeps satisfaction blood happiness is . 
we know money is very important , targets are 
we know that happiness is mostly happy with people that like to spend time with people with people we 
there 's other pleasure , but this is real . 
so if you 're going for maximize the social species of self , end end going to end up doing very in the end . 
the conclusion from what i said here is that we really really supposed supposed to think of happiness a well for a being 
it 's completely totally different notion concept 
now , very quickly , another reason , we about happiness is not we can 't think that 're paying attention to the same that we in to be over of when lives and if we actually live . 
so if you ask the simple question , how happy the people are going california won 't get the right answer . 
if you ask this question , you think people in california must if have to be happier if if you say , ohio , we ohio , 
and what 's is , as you think about the in california , they think about the difference between california and other places , and this 's is we say , we 're , in .  in climate . 
now because that thing balanced is , you can eventually up at the end of some few people could end to california . 
and it 's interesting to follow what happens happening on with people who to california , to endeavor , happier be happier . 
we know that . 
but one thing will happen . they will think that 're very , because when you think about it , you will think reminded that as awful in ohio , the ohio state in ohio , and you will feel that you made made the right decision . 
it 's very difficult to think about well being well and i hope i 've give you a sense of how difficult it is . be . 
thank you . 
thank you . i have a question for you . 
thank you . 
now , when we were told on the couple weeks weeks of speech phone on his phone front they told me that there was a an pretty interesting result , came out of this survey . 
is that something you can take away with us because because you have a couple minutes ? 
daniel lesser ownership . 
i think the most interesting thing that we 've at the polling systems is a number we didn not not expected expected . find . 
when we look at what , how way of what when we . 
and it turns out that under under a income , , , a year , for americans , and is a very big sample of americans , about , but it 's a big , sample , under a dollar under in the year . 
 . . 
dk . . . 
we get an very flat line . 
i mean i i have saw these flat lines . 
what 's is obviously spending realizes 't give you luck , but that lack of money is surely , certainly be connected misery miserable , and we can do that misery , very , very clear . 
the as you make more money you make more money when income you 're more . 
that 's not true for emotion . 
but , , the the entire effort effort , it 's about life , freedom , the of happiness . 
if people would seriously this disagreement seriously , i mean it it all seems to put everything we think in believe , terms of taxation tax , for so tax on on on tax 
is there a chance that politicians , who actually take a out make a merit for the seriousness and this , make policy driven the serious meme ? policy 
the recognition will slow slow in the u states , not a matter , but in the u .k . that it 's happening to happen , and it other countries , they 're transitioning . the u .s . 
the are also , i think they should think happily they should thinking about happiness when they think politics . 
it 's going to take a while time , and people will debate , they 're going to try to study happiness , or if they want to study and study life , so we 've got to have this debate soon need . 
that will influence policy , i think , in the years years . 
this is i think , will going to be part of the next five or two decades three decades recent to be the national statistic of 
now , it think this theme , , or should be least have most interesting debate to being next few years is follow the 
thank you for the invention of the economics . 
thank you , 's . 
i 'm jane . i make computer games . 
i 've been becoming an online now years now , and my goal for the next decade is to make it easy easy to save the world in the world world as to save what into online games . 
we 're currently spending billion games a week doing online . 
some of you might think , well , maybe is a lot of time time games .  
maybe something too much , given how many issues we have in really in the real world . 
but actually , according to my future , the future thing , is exactly the exact . 
three billion hours a week , it nearly enough to solve the world 's most urgent problems in the world . 
in fact , i 'm convinced that if we want to survive on this planet , this planet , we have to increase those time . . 
i was playing it the time it eight time at two hours a week . 
and might seem simple bit rather a , so i 'm it , if we can work problems like hunger , climate , climate change and climate strife and obesity , i think we need to try and do games for for eight hours hours a week a finish at least end of the end of the day . 
no , i mean it really . 
why ? this picture a final of i think , therefore games think play such for survival of the human species in the future are seriously . 
he wanted to get the emotion to so so he set the players a front of 
this is one of the classic expressions when play . 
if you 're not a player , you some can some of the many of the balkans . 
you probably see this sense of urgency , something frightened is a great , but concentration a concentration concentration , and is a , very hopeful a commonly to solve one problem . 
this is a player who 's on the brink of a fence freezing . 
oh , you know . . ok . so , have some players here . 
so victory is a result , an acute positive , that previously didn 't know that they were feasible at all . 
it was almost beyond the imagination . 
and when you reach into , shocked 're shocked to they 're capable of actually something able to do this . that 's a victory . 
this moment is on short contact a pissed off . 
and this is what we see to look on millions of faces around the the the world , if we 're the obstacles of the next century , the face against any whom one against tremendous there tremendous successes row . on margins mark abortion one . . manifest margins . 
well , unfortunately , we tend see it real face in we encounter the tough issues . 
i call it as first , 's i 'm sick life , and it 's actually my face , you ? yeah . 
that 's how i am living in in life i 
this is graffiti graffiti in my former home , berkeley , california , california i was studying why we 're more to be better at we real life . 
this is a problem that a lot of players have . 
we think we don 't do as well as in 're in games . 
and i 'm not only less it much , even i 'm going to read doing . that . 
and in reality , if we fail to if we run obstacles , we often feel like . 
we feel overwhelmed . we feel deeply . we feel deeply to us , we deeply depressed , spiritual cynical . or cynical . 
we 've never got we no got like if , , play don 't have in . 
and this is what i 'm to study as a doctoral student . 
why is it impossible to think , could you just accomplish it ? ? 
how can we translate that visceral of play in reality ? 
so i started looking with the world warcraft warcraft , sharing provides what provides the common environment in problem problem combined . 
and i 've found some things that epic 's epic in online worlds to so this . possible . 
but not just any mission , but a mission , 's going at the perfect level of the computer . right ? 
so , is what they do . 
they never get a problem that solve . 
but , 's always no lot things of the edges , so you have going to get . but there 's no unemployment unemployment in the of warcraft . 
you 're not signing around and turning 're doing cardboard , something very and controlling 're always to do very out very you things 
and there are tons of staff . 
anywhere they 're going , hundreds 're going to be hundreds of thousands of people who work with them to be do a real mission . 
and furthermore , there epic story , this inspiring story , why we are and what we have to do . 
we get this all positive positive feedback all 
they 've probably heard of how level high strength and strength , or intelligence . 
this constant feedback feedback flux there there 's not in real life . 
when when i leave this stage step , i don 't know , crazy idea , crazy idea . 
i 'm not getting the feedback . 
they 're just better than reality . 
that is not necessarily something bad . 
it might bad maybe 
so the first three will go . . 
ok , so when we talk about how much time we spend with playing time , this only only when just when you feel the time in keep , the rate of human development is very , what very impressive very much . 
but also , because it turns out , we using this time , we 're actually putting forward money on the , we 're really going what we 're capable of doing to the . 
we evolve come to think in adaptable , creature . 
that 's the truth . i think that 
so , , hours is that a very interesting number , for reasons . 
first of all , children children in the u .s . , the exact grand for the spent is the strongest them in school , from class to to at the secondary of high school , they 's never been a good school . 
so you know the theory of success success , the theory of the . hours . 
we 're going to do as good at doing 's always to do , how the important , to the most momentous people in the world . 
so what we have here is a full generation of young people who are masters . 
so the top question is , what is the teacher match  ?  
so many people have now arrived in the world that spend at least an hour , online games . 
this these are our master gamers . tens people who are extraordinary comfortable at something something . 
and over the next decade , we have a billion players who are extraordinarily in whatever . are . 
if you haven 't heard it . . 
you 're expect a additional billion players over the next decade . 
so we have total billion player . 
so i started started to think about what it is to we going to to do this master 
players are think that a movement in victory ability is possible , and it 's always trying to do 
player don 't sit around . 
players are masters in spiders spiders are more general . the spiders of 
there 's a lot of interesting research showing show 're showing more people during after playing with them , even if they defeated defeated us evil evil . 
and the reason is that is that it requires a lot of trust to play with someone . 
we trust that somebody who time with us , that the private of the is will be , have the same goal and we 'll be with it . 
so this is what 's happening now that cooperation is expanding , and it 're trust and link with each other . 
as build upon social relationships as 
you know , there 's a reason why the average word biography the brain dirt is playing eight hours a week , 
the reason is that when we play playing , we 're actually , we 're actually working really , to harder than when do or , relax . 
we know that as human human being optimal , if we do our hard work , critical do it . 
and player are always ready to work really when they get the right task . 
and finally , survival meaning . 
here 's a hundred hi who stand gathering to the the right lights on the right they 're all familiar with all wikipedia , the wiki wiki of the world . 
the second largest wiki in the world , with almost , story is is the world of warcraft . 
five million people use using it every month . 
they 've been more information about world videos printed 's internet , the internet as anything else in any other mosque world . 
it make a epic story . 
they 's making epic global to create the world 's warcraft . 
ok , so these are four people who to a artifact , players are super powerful , watergate , individuals . 
it 's people who believe they can change the way . a single world 
and the only problem is that you think you can change virtual worlds , but not the real world . 
that is the problem i 'm trying with . 
his work is brilliant . studied studied why people spend so much time doing energy in money in online worlds . 
and this is an economist . so he 's logically . 
and he says . . . 
so he says that makes makes up , because the can get into worlds more than than in real life . 
they can relate in games as desperately social ties than they life . they get more and in play in real life than real do real real life . 
so , he says , it 's perfectly logical logical that players spend more of in virtual virtual world than in real life . 
i 'm not waking for , that 's logical . 
we need to begin to turn the real world into a game . 
my inspiration comes from an event , which it years 
the were dying . the people were dying . 
it was a extreme situation . it needed an extreme solution . 
and then the the next day you would play . and the next day you would . 
just like that , we 're going to set a games today . 
we 're playing to games to to get away violation 's the world . 
we 're going really on it work everything that need 't , the real world , especially that real real gratifying in real life , and we 're really satisfying into out we need out games . 
but it 's 't have to be the end . 
this is extraordinary interesting . 
they divided the division of two halves . 
they were playing a play out to the merry and the daytime , and catching a adventure . 
this sounds crazy , right ? 
and geologists found a a global multinational south the was almost years , which could explain what . 
so this might be the story . 
perhaps they guys been rescued your people through play by they 've years for years , and , and then that intuition intuition has and so that they had learned much information know around one other that that they 've saved the whole civilization . 
so , we can do this . . 
we 've been playing in warcraft since warcraft 
i 'm saying we we are willing to be a very for our own game . 
we should be responded directive convention half of us spend an hour playing day nine until we solved solved the problem of the world . 
i know you 're going to solve , how do we real world problems in and that question the what i have been working on the last years at working future for the future . 
we 've got this banner in our office palo palo alto , it we ought to be able to understand the future . 
we don 't want to try and tell the future before . 
what we 're to do is we the future . 
we want to make the best website , and then make people make this idea that reality try make life . 
we 're not us easy , reach and giving people the opportunity to do it . 
i 'm going to show you just briefly three games that i designed to try and get people epic their epic future work to 
this is world world without oil .  
play game is from . 
we 've tried this have this game with players gamers , and we 've been undercover them the last three years . 
and i can tell you , it was a changing experience . 
nobody wants to change his life because it 's good for the environment or or because we should . 
but when they 're in a wild adventure and and 're going , this 's going to go oil of oil .  
this is a fascinating adventure where be about . 
find out how you would most of our people have retained most to forces in you the 
the 's an rendering vial the gross of a thousand that people have existed years on the planet . 
but in our game , instead of just people , we 're saying , we 're all . the dream team and it 's our job , energy , to , our , health security health , and national future of justice . 
 . players for a month . . . 
and the last thing we going we do going on march , , and it 's a game in collaboration with the world bank . 
we 're working with statistically in all sub saharan africa , and we 're them social learning to to learning . 
i come to the end . 
i want like to ask you something . 
what do you think is going to happen next ? 
we have all these fantastic players we we have games that showing we be done , but we don not saved saved the real . 
now , i hope that you agree agree with me that the is human resources that we can use use to live in real life , and that games have have a great significance significant change . 
i hope hope that we 're a a survive on that planet in the past century . 
and i hope you 'll play with me and play . 
so i 'm , let 's start the reverse games . 
thank you . 
i 'll read you post . 
but actually , it was a copy job in the early ' s , i was beginning beginning with elementary school and and that started to start to build my family 's of my family and shape their sorts of things , terms to the kids around around the world . 
if would take this statement embarrassing i would be born into a world that someone feel like me person who a person , singularly 't swing their lives in any meaningful in but today i 'm going to be greatly honored about the opportunity , the adventures i which i 've begun experienced . 
unfortunately , it 's not much lot better . 
but it 's not just words words . 
it 's about what we think about the who we with these words . 
it 's about the values that are in these words , and how we construct these . . 
our language determines our way and way we think at the world and the people around us . 
so what do we actually mean a have manifest people human being a domestic person ? is a common sense ? 
wouldn 't it be much to open them ? 
and dr . p axe carried a lot of life and was just the work that they just how with a working . 
i found the time that i spent spent in in this hospital just seemed up very great until my was a my physical therapies . 
and one day he he noticed me at one of those exercises these these this were just like , and he said to say , wow , you , so strong , and get got a very strong , child young girl , and 'll going to have a tape of one of these projects tape practically 
and if you can i , i 'll give you hundred dollars .  
this is just one example of many , sophisticated , than journalism the , the able to stimulate the imagination of a child . 
our language behind to the changes that which in changes in many cases were caused by a technological change . 
but the reality is the matter is , we change changing , of 're totally course , by the challenge , whether they 're emotional , emotionally , emotionally they 're both . 
and i 'm saying that 's 's good . 
there are nothing some life to our lives . 
and i tend matter to see my shadows . 
and i i realize that he 's very present , sometimes he 's barely visible , but he 's constantly with me . 
and we don 't like our kids , if we give them the sense that they can 't adapt . 
you have to separate two things , you of matters an medical matter , as identity of and , and for others , believe that i 'm stymied disabled . 
and to be honest , the only real and permanent , , i had to be is is that the world is all the time , can describe to with these these . bias . 
in our increasingly , our are to our the the hearts and to tell you the communicate the cold cold , the their medicine medicine , or even make forecast forecast of quality of life , life that they expected to focus care , that that we don 't want to put a possibly opportunity that we is . . 
and perhaps the current concept is is 're looking at is something 's broken in a target , and how we repair it , for every one , time the pathology , 's pathology go the pathology . 
if we don 't treat a human being in and all these forces and choices of effectiveness we is , we addition to recognizing and the can fight the the natural battle that you might need to , another another disease . 
we mean an an enormous person worth which has a value for our society . 
and the important , it 's between the perception between our sense , and our great human ingenuity . 
we should not really this nasty all time or stones , we should not try to avoid it , we if we 're them under the carpet , it 's about understanding 's about trying faith odds to optimism . the . 
it think it 's really a more bit about important to to really some neurobiological in there work , that to , but that we 're really being to be this embrace , embrace , to actually a fight for and perhaps use it . 
in this year , we were we birthday we charles darwin and his s , years ago , had written about evolution , darwin , my eyes , in some mind , has something very was very true in human nature . 
it conflict . creativity emerges . 
not only darwin 's work we we know that the ability of survive and survival and and , costly human of the human mind is designed by conflict conflicts 
so again again , moving and this change and the greatest skill of humans beings . 
and maybe we even from it from which which single break we are if we actually actually tested . 
perhaps that 's exactly the 's as about there 's a sense about any sense of interest , i sense of myself , that i me feel powerful sense of how own power . 
we can give ourselves a a gift . 
we can give a adversities a new importance beyond severe times . 
maybe we can see a change in a of change as 's see . 
there is still change in terms of a change we 're not adapted to . 
i think the most damage damage we have to do is is to we should be normal . 
so 's ask who the normal score be , no about of about 
there 's no normal . 
you are the usual . the typical thing . but not the regular one and , you if you really want to know this poor person , really really want to know familiar when they really do really ? 
i don 't think so . 
it would be great if we can take this paradigm to one an layer of the opportunity to even the it a to a more dangerous way we dangerous with the change , so we can share release the forces of very , and invite you children , share their and bring them to bring them special special capabilities in society society . 
there 's evidence that neanderthals were already around neanderthals five thousand years ago , and and wearing severe injuries with their injuries , and that because the life experience in this battle experience was valuable for the .  
they have not freeze from a and ineffective they they were considered as special and valuable . 
it was summer , and i had chicken statue 
and i hear how guy going , well , you the 's not , , he 's heaven .  
and i 'm looking around and i see this older man . i have no idea who he is . 
and i was , sorry , sir , we we know ? i can 't remember you .  
and he said , well , you shouldn not aware to remember me . 
when i first saw her , i took her from of her belly .  
oh , so , 's . 
and of course , it did it . 
this was dr . , , a man who who i only only known to tell from my day because of course , elated was , on delhi birthday to to two weeks late . 
the doctor i had to been officially with my mom on research , and so knew that my parents who brought me to travel world , not . 
he said to me , i had to tell your parents that you would never walk , and never way never be moveable like other who or children child , or you could never have a self life , and since you 've hid it lies .  
and he called that part of his course by the x factor , the potential for human will .  .  . 
you can 't easily enough how critically this factor for the quality of life lives 
and dr . yunus more , i said , i 've that kids when you don 't get anything else , and even if you just get a more back , if you have going to be children , , you can get children , . .  
see dr dr . yunus has altered his content change . 
he had embraced to understand that the medical diagnosis is and how someone is do so it is they things are different . 
and also also think , in into mind over the , if you had me at years i had been annoyed if i had turned legs to legs legs and and bones , then would have had no horrible . 
i was desperate at be the normal at the time . 
if you ask me this today , i 'm not sure sure . 
and this is what because i 've experienced something with my legs and not that spite of this kind . 
and perhaps that change also happen because i wanted to run as many people who open , instead open trying doors to rather of keeping people trying wanted willing to stand to narrow me , a comedy . 
see see , it really really just a human being that you you to 're your forces , and they are through . form . 
if you allow someone to , your to activate forces own forces , the human mind is so generous if you can model it , and for someone in a critical moment , open , you 're very good teachers for 
they teach them open to open their own teaming . 
again , what potential we want to compete with each other , 
they call this in the study of in the u states , we call this as program . 
the students gets get up into . 
and the a high test pilot takes harder the for the better teachers and and so on . 
and then had , trips and time time three months , students who gave very good at a of them , and they were told they were , conscious , they were very clever . and they 'd wrote a head one . a months . 
and of course , he 's breaking the heart around , that the students person has saying , they were just sufficient . 
and then it was after the three months . 
but only those who were in school , aside other ones apart from the students getting school 
what critical number was place study was that the teachers weren not prompt . 
the teachers didn 't know that something changed changed . 
and just were just saying they the instructor head the the head are the students with the grade , and as have as they 've them have be and and to they 've taught them how to treat . 
the only real of disability is a physical ghost that was broken , has not hope , he no more hope , finds a , he 's 't give out our natural curiosity , our inherent curiosity and our profession , 
come on me . thank you . 
how would you like to be better than you 're at the moment ? 
suppose i said that by a few of of different genes , a better memory has have more , more elaborate , and more quickly . 
or do you want to be skilled powerful , stronger . 
would you like to become more attractive and more attractive ? 
what if living health ? 
what would you like most most ? 
what would you like to have if you could have one ? 
creativity . 
how many people would choose creativity creativity ? 
raise your hands . let me see . . 
some of them probably perhaps about as imaginative as people here . 
that 's very good . 
how many people that a for a good memory ? 
it a more . 
what about fitness ? 
a few less . 
what about longevity ? 
if you guys have of them could it would be a very different world . 
is all all this conceit ? 
or is it 's possible ? 
evolution has been a fairly subject here at the , but today i would to give you a study eyes to interested . 
but if you accept biological evolution , you you think this this 's all about the past , or is it about the future ? 
does it take for other brother and does it also to us ? 
this is another view of life . life . life . 
in this image , i 've handed a preparation time in every directions in because as you look at the edges of life cycle life , all the species 's exists been based on the branches of these peaks in evolutionary evolutionary phase they 've had it they 've had it from riding of its strength . 
we were lending posted together by a common of modern ancestor about six or eight million years ago . 
in this period , maybe or or so , modes of been different types of hominids . 
some of and went . 
we have been here for about , years . 
it 's like we 're quite disconnected from the other parts of the tree of life , but in most most of , the most mechanisms are pretty similar in 
and what we 're talking about bacteria is that every 're aware conscious that us of us gut more that we single is going to exceed bacteria to bacteria than we does going to happen able to happen in the rest of our bodies ? 
maybe it 's about eight many times sizes 
i mean , do about if you ask listening , when coke 're listening to ask looking to the definition of sense of freedom , do you thinking about the ? 
it 's warm , it 's dark , 's moist , it 's very . it 's very comfortable . 
and you 're bring all the nutrients you you could offer have no effort to offer . 
but else , they are a important for for these bacteria , just like important to their life . 
they 're observing poor essential of essential material , and they 're keeping them against certain pathology . 
but what 's going to happen in the future ? 
are we in a way of state evolutionary equilibrium behavior in a form ? 
or are we going to be a to become something that that which is is better at the the environment ? 
we were . 
i was intrigued by the elegance and beauty of biology . 
sexual reproduction . 
in fact , you could say that at the point of this brain at at the same time in the evolution of our ancestors in going to happen at the moment moment as sexual reproduction . 
now i 'm a unfortunate student , and i i was a college student , i thought , okay , sex , , death as death , sex , death to pretty rational act to have at the point , but it the by year , it has come to my cause . 
i came come to understand the the feelings of george burns who who read reading their show in over the ' of his year . 
it opens the door . 
she 's looking at him and says , i 'm here for super sleeper .  
 this is wonderful , says says , i 'll take the soup .  
i tried to preserve the body . 
i wanted to keep us engaged . 
i wanted to recover the health of a disease . 
i wanted us to lead a and healthy life . 
evolution is all about the the genome on the next generation , mating taking generation after generation . 
i think we would all have the mood for all history of has 've got got to understand , as he said , i don 't want to make the relationships through my work . 
i 'm trying , by not don 't die .  
evolution does 't necessarily mean avoiding the . . 
it doesn 't just mean the most , the largest , the the fastest , and not even the smartest one 
evolution the formations creatures able the environment , the respond 're to environment environment . 
it 's just the only test of survival and success . 
so what that that mean when as back into what 's in evolution , and how we think about the place of humans in the , and especially as we would forward into the next stage , i would argue there there are a range of opportunity . 
the first is we 're not going to move forward . 
we 've come a sort of equilibrium . 
a second possibility is that it 's going to be an evolution of the traditional species , naturally course , or on nature of nature forces . 
and the argument here would that the wheel begin to be down slowly evolution , evolution , but they are also natural . 
and as far as the isolation , if we 're to of as distant planet , it will be to the environment , insulation environmental , possibly , natural natural , a natural way . 
but there 's a third chance , a very attractive , fascinating and interesting possibility . 
i call calling it neo evolution new the evolution that is not easy , but , of decided , make us as individuals , in fact decisions we make . 
now , how could this happen ? 
how could it do that ? 
let 's look by looking at the reality that people make make decisions about their offspring . 
they are , some cultures , a order to have more men than to . 
it 's not necessarily good for society , but it 's the the individual and family family is gaining . 
so think think , not only could your choose your to choose your gender of your child but but to to make the genetic illness , would make the disease that would cure and help disease to 
what if you could make the genetic changes , prevent alzheimer or alzheimer 's disease or we eliminating it to to remove the disease of either or to remove the lesion ? 
wouldn 't they not to do those genes in your genes ? 
the human genome project project started , and and it took years . 
it cost . billion billion dollars . 
and the years , when it was finished , they were able to do the for million dollars into four course in to four months . 
today , you can have a sequence of three billion base pairs of human genome , a price from about , and and and in all space of about a week . 
it won not to take more long until the , that there 's be , human genomes , and it will be increasingly available for everyone . 
these changes are coming . 
the technology that can human insulin can make in bacteria viruses , the cannot simply save their , but also to the against other viruses . 
can you imagine something good that comes out of tobacco from 
so imagine two they just two two , little changes that 
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells of change the cells of their descendants ? 
who don 't want to have babies healthier child 
and then the analytical technology , the same engine of can enable science to achieve the changes that could be disease to to prevent us from being well compelling educated , makes people can return lighter off , get well can get higher better . memory product . 
why not live longer ? 
these are going to be his mind deaths . 
and if we 're at to be where where we can pass this to the next generation , being , and we can adopt the attributes that we want to be transformed , being style style of evolution evolution . 
we 'll have a process that might probably taken in the line years and , and we can compress it down to the a thousand years , and maybe even next the next years . 
these are decisions with have the to be dealing the grandkid , or their grandchildren , or their grandchildren , have going to have to deal dealing . 
we 's use these choices to shape a society that 's better , that that , , more , more ? 
or are we selectively choose loads of various that we want , for not for others ? 
these are the kinds of questions we 're to face . 
and deepest deepest wisdom all , will we ever be able to get the wisdom , and the wisdom we we need to get , to order way , to make these decision ? 
in the good ways in the evil guys and perhaps the old teens , perhaps , these decisions will going to be fading . 
thank you . 
i want you to imagine now , imagine a ready wearable to which gives you coach , or a different design task that helping go foreman get through . . 
so at 're berkeley has these robot hyper robot devices . 
they 're not going anything but that they 're in the morning , and you some extra strength and will increase your speed , and help help to help you with whatever , say example , balance balance . . example . 
so this is indeed the real , coherent complex of man and machine . 
but not only that they they they connect with the universe and and the other devices out there . 
this 's not just a crazy idea . 
to show you now what we 're working on is we 're beginning to talk about the american soldiers that contribute average on contribute on average on about pounds on that 's driven up the bit that they should carry more equipment . 
so we thought we we would take this challenge and create a exo who would help to deal with this problem . 
so his flexible design has him to be partial bleed and to scan very exercise fly extremely highly movements . 
it feels what i want to do , i want going and and then i to strength and perseverance . 
so it 's true . 
so let 's look at our perspective habitats the wheelchair , something , i 'm advocating passionate about . 
there are million people who in the world . are now in the wheelchair . 
that 's about one percent of the population . 
and that 's actually a conservative estimate . 
we 're about often about a young young person in in the heyday of life life at at the , 's , he was struck by fate and the wheelchair , the only option . 
but it 's also about aging citizens , their number of people are enrolled . . 
and so the only option about you can get about one of those things that you like is the know , the only wheelchair is a wheelchair . 
and by the way , it 's been for since , as i must been to say , is really successful really successful commercial . . 
so we thought we could begin writing a fundamentally new chapter in mobility . 
thank you . 
i i said , amanda , , our our ward . 
it 's got sensors . 
not long after that , a doctor office 's and says 's , you , you 'll going going to leave back .  
but nothing was invented to that let me go back , . 
thank you . 
as you can see , we have the technology we we have the platforms to us and with them . 
it 's in our hands , and we have the whole potential here to change the lives of the generations not just for the soldiers , or amanda , for dedicated , here using , as for all , but everybody wheelchair . 
thank you . 
at home in new york , i 'm the head of the nonprofit educational called robin hood . 
i remember my first fire . 
i dog ! i was losing woke . 
well , i was the next one . 
the captain 's just did knock me . 
he said , well , you go to the house . 
you 've got to go up to you 've got to get a the fire , and this woman , you 've got a take some pair of shoes .  
i swear to 
now , not exactly what i hoped was that up , the i was up the the , the hall that to the corridor along along with the real past that who the time to that point where so pretty pretty did finished in to get a bedroom to get couple shoes . 
i know what you 're thinking now but i 'm not a hero . 
i carried my team to pickled to the front , where i went to the body body and the saw loved beloved person 
one moreover , a number of abandoned sized offenders someone a few more had actually brought her a few shoes . 
and you know what i i learn ? 
they 're all important . 
don 't wait a make a difference in life life one until you have achieved your first million . 
if you have something to you give give it to . 
touch 're in a pantry , where and 's a park in the neighborhood . 
be a mentor . 
not every day , a chance to offer us to human of a , but every day offers offers the opportunity to change one . 
so they you go , the shoes . 
thank you very 
bruno giussani mark , mark , come back . 
thank you . 
ladies and gentlemen , their familiarity . 
this is the world of the wild bonobos in the jungle jungle . 
bonobos are with together with chimps , our closest lives relatives to us . 
that means we have a common ancestor , a evolutionary grandmother who lived about six million years ago . 
now , chimps are actually well with their background . 
but informed show us the other side of the coin flip 
they 've came up with this 's going because because that 's having to , where actions things have been been observed in the violence . 
but unfortunately unfortunately , bonobos are the least familiar primates 
the congo is a paradox an diversity and and beauty , but also the heart of the violent of a violent perpetual controversy in a and so very , almost has had a called of the of as first world war of world war . 
and yet , in this country of violence and chaos , you can obviously a , , that the trees have deeply . 
who are those relatives ? 
we know it as a war instead of apes , because they have percent sex vigorously 're sex sex with skill , with changing and and limited social . conflict . conflicts change . 
bonobos like humans love play their lives long . 
for us and you 's essential for play the the and to the cost of with tolerance . 
and this 's what we learn to doing and the rules of the game . 
play trends process of creativity and resilience , and it 's all about the rise of diversity of a interactions , diversity of behaviors , variety of behaviors . through of behaviors . 
and when you watch the bonobos play , you see the evolutionary origins of human origins error dance and dance . 
now , i don 't know how they play , but i want to show you just unique images straight from the wildness . 
first first , a bonobo parent bonobo , , i don 't think of unison along along with wine . 
look what what she 's doing . 
this could be the evolutionary origin of it grabs it in the hood .  
just that i think it 's more of , not ? 
yeah ! 
i think , way that 're is ourselves , and we find finding and we 're finding a , our own and outside worlds . 
and it 's this playful curiosity that will us work , and interact , the unexpected registration that make the areas forms 
the secret is that game to this the . 
games is not silly silly . 
it 's crucial . 
bonobos and humans and humans are both course , are , and and and stealing and stealing . 
thank you . 
i want you to imagine two two two two toddlers at at in the very same exact at same at the same moment , every baby sucks .  
so two pairs of plankton . . . 
now , don 't want to be too much time taking on the work because because , as they evolve going to come the major procreation on every whole , they 're not be listening to me . 
just imagine that for a moment . 
and in the other case , the sperm is putting a cs which that hits hitting , the x halves of the x . 
they are up of he 's default up . 
we 're going to come back to on look at these guys . 
when most of my edits match i have two hat groups points 
i a hat , i got going to go with the story of the anatomy . 
in this case , i worked working with people asking sending i asked sending out the social of norms to 
but because this individual stuck 't really the receptors receptors to see the testosterone , the body doesn 't respond to testosterone testosterone . 
so , testosterone , but not response to it . 
after then a consequence , the body is almost the after the female independence 
when the kid born born , she looks like a girl . 
she 's a girl . she 's being up as a girl . 
but it mostly cuts the time it get hit , and their breasts develop they develop , but they don 't get their period , somebody else comes to it little bit . 
and they make a couple tests , they find out that instead of a toilet and uterus , in fact , in their , and have a y chromosome . 
and the 's important to understand that if think think think this this is for be a male , but they 're not really . 
they 're in the back of our bodies . 
i example a to couple of years ago , i got the telephone off the year old man year was born as a boy , he had sex girlfriend friend he had sex with his girlfriend , lived with his girlfriend and and he had found figured out that he had had a uterus executive ago . 
and when he was born , he saw a young boy had something insight what anyone ever . 
we don 't know exactly why this does happening . 
so , can occur in so different forms . 
in so cases , these people are perfectly healthy . 
the reason they in often done all recently , different kinds of things is they they 're using social social categories . 
what we typically do is our system based on the idea that a particular precision with a specific expression with 
so we 've the concept that being a woman is called means having a feminine identity to be a black person , suggesting to apparently , to african to system in terms of their . 
so we have this terrible idea . 
so we 've captured a a our culture a lot of romantic ideas about mass spread . 
and our nation is really based on a very romantic concept of individualisms . its ocean . 
now , can imagine what amazing it is when children kids are born born , the people are in a body . 
and i had to explain to journalist that there 's no test . 
and that 's not just in in gender . 
it 's has a degree of terms of the things that 's 's out that 's much a more complicated than our body . 
we enter entering our single planning in in we 're gathering things to we 've 't know to innovate . 
we 're going to , for instance , that we 're at least percent of our dna with chimps . with 
what should we do with make you that the fact that we 're about to single by few few nucleotides in the lesion ? 
we 're this in all sorts of different of human human life . 
one of the areas we which we see this as the , in our current today , the united states , are the fighting of the and the beginning of end end of life . 
we have very strong very tough not quite confused that public medicine , , when somebody is dead . 
our ancestors had to have never been so hard at fighting the question of when someone were been dead . 
they just a contractor shout feather held maintain 't reach the nose , and when they moved , they still did they still . 
if it 's not moving , , you 've got it away . 
but today we we 're in a situation where we 're going wild very important animal organs and want want to take them out differently people . be running livable . 
and as we caught caught get caught on the battle with really hard questions , someone dead dead , and that 's where 's us a a really difficult situation where we don 't have that of categories like the they used to be . 
now you would think that the whole thing break is of is someone who me was really happy to make happy . 
i 'm political , i 'm having any with with un , but i have to admit it 's me nervous . 
and to realize that these categories are really much more insecure insecure fully we thought , is difficult . 
and it makes me sing thrilled with terms way . 
so to tell them from this core device , i need to start off , i of all , that i 'm a big fan of founding founding fathers . 
the fathers , era were the my view of well original activists , and that 's why . 
as you all remember , our own founding announced the concept of the , and the monarchy based monarchy , on the based on very very simplistic notion of anatomy . 
they had a concept of laying blood 
the founding members has have back and they replace to through a new anatomic relation , and this idea was all people were created same equivalent . 
democracy grew at but at the same time , the science also in . 
and if you look at the independence of for talk about nature and the god 's nature . 
they don 't talk about god and nature of god . 
they 're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are . 
and as part of that , they managed us a concept of was suggested by commonality similarities . 
and that that , they were really really prepared with the future movement . 
they didn 't think so much about it , but what they did for us was great . 
so what happened years afterwards ? 
for example , women who flew the dedicated to of voting anecdotal ubuntu century , school , which says that they say is the anatomic is the an had talking is and they said , , we have a crime live , the case funders who we should have the right to vote of citizenship on the right , ownership of the . , etc . , 
and women women argued had argued successful deal . 
again , humans different colors crossing , which is notoriously an anatomical approach of introducing introducing , fueled effective out of suburbia gold . 
of of course , the problem is that , we begin to look at all the similarities , need to begin to think in why question , why we maintain certain distinct . 
now , you you 'd to have dead , anatomically , in our culture . 
i 'm 't want to give you fish like a human being a . a human being . 
i don 't want to say that we should take from from the anatomy . 
i don 't want to say that your old should have have the to having sex or to get . 
so there are some anatomic the an made sense to me , and i reason , i think we should be up . 
but the challenge is to try to figure out what it is and and why we retain them , and whether they make sense . 
so let come back to those two things that have been given late at very of the talk . 
we have two creatures , both the middle high date . 
imagine one were born , , of you , and one were born seven three months of symbol warning , so they which she were born on june . 
heinrich , so were been born on the other side of on so he 's phoned on march , 
we 're still finding other bacterium of what your rights are . 
heinrich , we think that he thinks he 's not going to tell a male , that he 's going to be over data , that he 's going to receive the male , he 's now to be now moved charge but 's going to be busy split , but he has not going to worry about . 
but , not in all states , can 't perceive the same thing the the state , the are of state in all states , and that 's right to get married . 
heinrich , heinrich 's can marry married in every woman , but now can now be a a woman state of veterans . 
so we have replaced these permanent categories of are problematic and in many ways , and questionable . questionable 
and for me , the question what we we going to do , that 're going to do this science in discovery kind of engaging this this , that we 're going to get a point where we have to admit that democracy , a it 's a rebel , 's occurring on this ? , right ? 
i don 't want to give up the science , but at the same time , it feels like much as if science is self doing it . 
so where do we go ? 
it feels like our culture a take a kind of pragmatic posture , we need to draw a line , so we 're going to move it somewhere .  
but a lot of people get getting into very very strange location . 
so for example , texas has to a point they that a man , to marry that woman that that you don 't get a y chromosome , and a woman has to marry her chromosome . 
now , in practice , people won 't tested against their chromosomes . 
if we look at one of modern modern fathers of modern democracy , dr dr . martin luther king , he gives offering us in dream to kind speech a kind of solution . 
he says we we should not look people about by his color , but we judge your character , and to tell you about anatomy anatomy . 
and i want to say , yeah , that sounds like a really idea .  
but how do you do this in practice ? 
how do you choose people of their characters of their characters ? 
i also want to point out that i 'm sure sure that we should supposed to put willing right in terms to people like because because have to say , because i have to say , i know a golden of risk , which likely , for that some of them , know comfortable with people i know . 
it out to 's really difficult . 
do it really want to go this this direction ? 
i 'm not sure where we go going . 
what i know is that it really really important to think about the idea that the u states lead to think in asking to wonder about questions questions . 
we our effort to do our , we 've done a really good thing , and i think we would argue our things well the future . 
now defining we don 't exist in our conditions . 
but when on the phone was the was asked the phone , , and he asked him why he was this , was high intervention , his response was his solution , that these kids were going to be very , , and so he had to do it . 
i told him , well , have they have political political peer system , the way to cut that surgery ?  
the united states has incredible providing you incredible ability for allow people to be who ones that they are , necessarily to change the state of the will . 
and i think we need to be about leader . 
all , just just 'd like to try by i i want like talk that very . lot about the . 
and i want to think about the possibilities that democracy democracy might look like , or have looked , looked looked , if we 've more mothers for the mothers . 
and one of the things that i was found interesting is the difference between men and women in ways of the way they think and the the world . 
what we 've experienced from training studies that women , on every , but on average , tend to have a more social social relationships relations and the people for people who are in the group , . more 
and so , as we think about it , we have an interesting situation to think . . 
twenty years ago , when i did a , a of my favorites school asked asked asked me , say my interested at feminism , i considered considered myself a feminist , so do do a a really confusing question . 
he said , tell me what is a is .  
and i thought , well , this 's the dumbest question i 've ever heard . 
feminism is about the stereotypes to the way , sex , so the the , is is not a . 
but the more i was thinking about his question of to think more more might be something called a . in , 
and perhaps it 's going to be where we should go forward , if democracy take democracy over a century second out changes out to the body , energy bodies , to think about relationships . 
so that a human , if try to make a more connection , we think about what we can do for each other . 
thank you . 
but before i show you what i 'm going to do , i 'm going very broad relief business , and that 's me , . the city . 
but i don 't even anything new . 
ooh , nice . 
second was been able to clean reduce the power of energy in environment , to reduce the environment in my wallet , 
i mean , what am i going to try today ? 
is it going to be my size ? 
will i like the color ? 
is it going to cost less than a dollar price 
if all of you answers says , i feel like i 've . 
i come back to my suitcase , and i 'm telling you what i wrapped submitted my teds here ted week all at ted . 
i mean , what does you get so so many full block dosimeter tigers with full 
so i 'm going to show you exactly much what i brought with . 
i brought in seven of the underwear , and that 's all . 
i made making sure that i would to know anything i i thought going to find if if i first came , it springs . 
and since they didn 't know me when the woman that is leading around here at ted 's , i what i found . few things . 
and i 'd like to show you my pro that for this week . 
does this sound great ? 
as i 'm doing that , i 'm also to share some of the lessons from that that i 'm going , if i think that or not have to pursuing adventure adventure , not to share with 
let 's start with sunday . 
i call this radiant radiant tiger .  
you don 't have to spend a lot of money on look awesome . 
you can look almost every brilliantly for the than dollars . 
all whole outfit , including the peg took me me , and it was the most expensive piece that i was in all week . 
monday painted is something that 's top . 
when you 're happy , you 're going to get other people lucky . 
naturally quickly is being steeped overrated . 
i 've spent a lot of time in my life trying to be myself , and at the same time , to adapt able 
be just who you are . 
if you stand combining to stand yourself with people right people , you won 't just understand it you will appreciate it as 
wednesday morning hug her child . 
i i 'm please happy to say , thank say , thank you .  
thursday 's the key . we is the key . 
if you think you 're looking good at something , it 's almost certainly so sure . 
and if you think you don 't look good in something , you 're probably right . 
i grew up with a mother teaching taught me that day . day day . 
but it wasn 't until i got , i really realized to understand what that means . 
and i 'll just summarize for you . 
if you believe that 're inside and you the outside , there 's no you can 't carry . 
so there 's no excuse for someone in this audience . 
we should be able to rock everything we want . 
thank you . 
and finally , one become a lexicographer , very very , , is a great way to telling the world about a word that has nothing talk without having a word to it . 
it 's to me over and ever kept showing me every when when this came to me on this week just just because of what i was wearing . an experienced thing . and i had extraordinary talks . 
apparently , it doesn 't fit all into my little suitcase . 
so before i fell back to go back to , i 'm give that all all . . 
because the lesson that try to learn that way is that it 's okay to let . . 
thank you very much . 
thank you . 
good day , everybody together . 
i have a bit of showing bit of a bit of a bit i i 'd like to show you . 
think of this as a , a yo yo yo yo , . 
so me tell you a little bit about it . 
now , if you take this image , 'm of italian italian italian and every young in italy is growing in his picture with this image , his bedroom , but the reason why 'm showing you is going that which past s that which is very to happen very interesting in the past six decades . 
and little , , it was like that if you wanted to win a business , you would take your your budget and you money on a good driver , a good car . 
and when the car was good enough , then driver won seat , they won win that race . 
now , you need , if you want to win a race , actually , like like this kid something that that car that somehow real time , has sensors reviews that the information from from of the car , and then 're going it to , then using that car of thing to make that of material back and absorb possible back real time through and make things real time . 
our cities were been equipped in the last few years equipped with networks and electronics . 
they become computer in . free open way . 
and as computers , they a computer , they start to react to other way , dealing transformed to react , they 're driven and driven . 
just 'm just going that by the way , that cities are only two percent of earth earth 's land of , but percent of the global 's there there . 
so if we do something about cities cities , it is a big thing . 
beyond cities , all go all of that and of and and you drive them objects of everyday life . 
this is by the exhibition called the crime for moma later in the year , organized the in organized by the summer . 
it 's like me . me .  
now , all our objects , our environment , they to speak back to us . 
in a sense , it 's almost as if every atom gets on two , a sensor and a sensor sensor 
and this is radically changing the interaction that we have with with our environment . 
in a sense , it 's almost as if the old dream of michelangelo . . . 
now , today , our environment is beginning to start with to to respond . 
i 'm just going to show you just few more again , our idea of driving our environment and desire . 
let 's start with the first . 
now the first project i 'm going to introduce you , actually 's actually one in one , the of the first ones of our labs . 
it it was made a four italy seven and a half years ago . 
the summer marked a . 
it was a football cup . the world cup won 
and anyway , at end is ending won the the end of the end , 
now look can see what happened on that , just watching the activity that happens in the network . 
here here you see the city . 
am the , pre the game . 
you see the timeline . 
in in the afternoon afternoon , people are doing making calls phone and moving . 
the game tense starts to 
france is a portal . italy is a portal . 
people are getting a short call call from astute toilet . queue out in the . 
second . ending the normal of ask everyday ed . . 
one extension anti , second . . 
italy . yeah yeah . 
well , by night , went went you center to to celebrate . 
they watched the big piece . 
the by next day , all went to the center to put the and the prime minister at the same time . 
and then everybody went down . 
now , this is just an example of how we can feel today in city , in a way how how a way that couldn 't do it a few years ago . 
another example that 's 're in talking for though not about people , but for things we we 're using and consume . 
well , we , we know all about where our things come from . 
this is a map that tells you all the chips that a mac made computer as how they came together . 
but we only know a little bit where the go . 
so we 've actually designed some small marker strait to the garbage of the river . 
then we have the little pocket , , the have the little brands that went canning down be the trash and began to it . 
here are the results we 've just got . 
from seattle . . 
after a week . 
with realized that there 's been lot of inefficiencies in the system . 
we can do the same things in terms same way that 
the data was not available before . 
but the other thing is that think if if we watch every day , the cup we throw away , not simply , , that it 's still on the planet . 
and the tiny that we are throwing away out every day . 
and if we were to show that , then we can change behavior behavior change . 
so that 's why this project is this project is 
and the question was , how could technology combine new to combine new together to 
he was love it . 
and we got the building to design the reception in the stock . 
the whole building was of . . 
there 's no doors or windows , but if you 're going to reach in it , it 's open and let it go . it . 
the roof was coated also very as well . 
and when windy 're windy when , like you want to reduce the syringes , you can actually get the roof down . 
or you could close the building and all the whole architecture , like in this case , you know , that days , when you use the roof , well seeking you you , 's get images of people , were there , and say suck , suck suck destroyed the building .  
no , they did not destroy the building , it 's just that architecture architecture almost drifts disappearing . 
here 's how the building works . 
you can the person who what 's happening on inside . 
and here you see me trying to test the sensors that open up water up of the opening boxes not opened open pass wet . 
now , i should tell you what happened at night at all the the sensors stopped promoting sensing . 
but it , it that night , it was a lot more fun . 
not longer a building that would open up to make them be but a building that had still been silent and breaks through holes the in the water , you had to jump hurt without without wet wet . 
and this 's , to us , very interesting , , an , engineers , as , we about how , we all using the way people use using the that we 're designing . 
but the reality is always unpredictable . 
and that 's the thing nice about we 're doing to we things , and people , , interact with . 
and this is what brought us think about the following project that 'm showing you now 
imagine if you had a helicopters you which could have this flying the air and and we one of with you small pixel against death , almost gross monkey almost almost like a cloud capable can move across space . space . 
here 's the video . 
imagine a helicopter like seeing saw earlier that moving is moving the with other people . 
you can have this cloud . 
you can have a of flexible flexible display or display , like these one three formation in two dimensions . 
they can play with different ways of 
imagine the you look just contact of the screen , you you could appear in similar size of the computer , or in , in different dimensions , in your heads , 
if when you turn on the light , it looks like we did it this 
imagine that every single one is governed by 
it could have a one impulse , which one in which world 's people , from humans people the movement of humans or something . 
i 'd to show you a about much about i of all . 
and you see roberto . . 
so that can feel the whole movement . 
you can do it all the time . 
i want like to show you the latest project that 're working on . 
it 's something we work working on for the london olympics . 
it 's called the cloud .  
imagine that every one can these can could pest pest give a double double controlled a pixel justice system . 
i think that the remarkable events stephen events events last years has been happening , over the last decades , that been changed from a physical world . a digital world . 
this has digitized all into knowledge , and power it accessible through the internet . 
today , we can run it first time and the state of site the world this could show in the digital world , from the forces of forces forces to the physical world . 
and can be in our case , we 're use it to design and create a symbol . . 
this 's something built in the . 
but tomorrow , to can be , imagine us design the challenges , 're going to think about climate change , climate emissions like like the can then change from digital digital world through physical . 
so the idea is that we actually bring include people with involved in what they do together , collectively , do things 
they can move inside and do different types of experiences . 
you can actually look at it from the bottom , keep most important moments for the seat and other more way and more it as a kind of connection to the community . 
so the two , the physics cloud in heaven sky , and you at the top you can go , like the of national are can do . 
you can go in . 
thank you . 
as an artist , i context to to think very interested of it 
by my work , i try trying to make you that humans are not separate from nature , and that everything is connected to 
the first time i was ever the years ago at where i saw my first icebergs icebergs . 
i i grabbed grabbed by awe . 
icebergs might born as a calf , or by breaking them out of the . 
everybody iceberg is his own individual personality . 
they interact in a very sense of their environment and their experience . 
some refuse to give up and down up until the bitter ends while other people weren 't going to and more in in a seizure of 
when you look a a iceberg , you think that is , , , separated and just , way we often people . 
but the truth is this is far away that . 
as an iceberg , , i 'm breathing its ancient atmosphere . 
i take going to go with my photos so before like if i was making make portraits of my ancestors , in consciousness , that they 're in to be in in these moments in time , and they 're never to be again . 
and one of the ice is more than , years old . 
very rarely you will actually be an etching arrangement antenna 
so here you see it . . 
on the left hand see a little boat . 
that 's about five feet long . 
i want you to focus shape of the iceberg , where where it 's in the sand of the slope mine . 
you can see , 's rolling roll , and the boat has moving to the other side , , the guy stands standing there . 
he reaches about feet out of the water , or meters . 
and this video is real time . 
and just like that , you can show the different of his personality . 
thank you . 
my life is truly extremely blessed by the work of has been an amazing projects . 
but the of the , what 've been worked on , this was the this guy . 
then one day , came back and he , amy , my blockbusters .  
and that was the point of the . 
he can only use his eyes to his eyes . 
i was firmly the own . 
i have a company that makes a and animations , so it 's really a more bit more a we sense in the art of art and be in admire . 
i took with his dad and his brother and and said said , we 're give you this money . 
what are you going to do with this ?  
and his brother , i just want to talk again tony again . 
i just want to just you him , and i asked , stop , isn this not what i saw , hawking can 't tell able to communicate all the paralyzed using these devices ?  
the way people are 't available to  
and i said , how do you communicate ? ?  
so they communicate their hands along the 
i i marveled at how can that be ?  
so i had to the need just to put a darn and instead , , and i made 't got the check line about what i had saying , 'i should should cash for 
i was to be to sit a in the center of his brother and his dad , the , , my role with my , tony to tony , we 're gonna to talk a machine , and we 're going to find a way to make his work again . 
because it is a farce that being in can of this can be be true itself , it can 't communicate .  
so i spoke some months later to a at a conference . 
so they 're doing , making these of this things 
they say that things things that are pointing up there , , life cycle . 
but there was always a life cycle in its presentation . 
this was the beginning of the trip . 
and about two years later , about a year later , after a lot of organization , a lot goes goes , forward , we 've come up with a few things . 
that was incredible . 
and he 's really , really funny , i 'm him , because intrigues with or 're or gets an e mail , and he thinks , i 'm so guy , is is 's terrific . .  
we also have seven leagues that are literally flown out from all the world to scattering the distant strip of the world . 
but for over two weeks , we 've been programming , we went to venice tumor , my kids were brought up be , and we made this dog . 
we took a horsepower has been dismantled engineered , we 've been it on an led light on an led light , , and now we 've got an device that 's freely it 's free to build it , we can make the code for free , for free , the , for can make for free . 
so we created created a device that is completely free of constraints . 
no spinal . 
and every , each quadriplegic patients can actually communicate with his eyes or drawing or 
thank you . 
thank you so much for , and was unbelievable . 
i love this image because because it 's the room of somebody else , and this is his room . 
so there 's all of this hype of spread , before the great moon , 
and this 's extraordinary is this is a picture , this is his life support system , and he 's looking above his life support system . 
we 've been to have the so so he can see out . 
and he the end of the he sent me an e last with this content for the very seven seven seven years , i 've drawn a bit bit of a little bit of a . 
i 've got that gut , i 've been out underwater , and finally somebody threw grabs down took their head down , so i can breathe .  
is 't that stopping boggling ? 
and that keeps us on and continues us on going . 
and we 've got to make much lot more on this a better better . this . . 
it 's an amazing device of viral device , but it comes out to a score . 
and somebody who has such a artistic potential makes so much more . 
so we 're figuring out how to make better quickly faster and 
and that time , we 've gotten got the have an recognition 
we won a couple awards . 
remember keep remember , it 's free , none of us make believe . 
it all comes down our own pockets . 
so the awards were , oh , that is fantastic .  
armstrong in killing about us , then , december , kept honored us us be of the the of the best inventions , which was really great . 
so i 'm intrigued to say that if you see at something that 's impossible , make it possible . 
make , do it all here same . 
and this question should everybody ask yourselves and every not ask just yourself at every single day where you have going to put a person that and over it if you don 't , when you don not ? and if you don 't . 
thank you . 
and i always tell people that i don 't want to come like a scientist . 
today i want to tell you about circles . 
now , an epiphany , generally whatever you , is you normally lose it somewhere . . 
you 're around the block and you take it out revelation revelation . 
this is a painting of a circle . 
it 's the kind of complicated circle i 'm going to share with you today . 
she rescued my life , letting me know the was been the toilet . 
it was how going in a racing pressure . 
and did it for three years . 
and i had to make out from the city . 
i had a thumb , i had , , and it went up san francisco in california , found a lover in the s and was in found it important to job at aids . . 
i 'm sad that we 've never known each other as adults . 
you can ask , by come to ohio , and please join together with the guy i know you you 've found it from 
well , the next day we we were in cleveland , 
we looked at them , we laugh , we kept , and we knew they had to be in a hospice . 
we found one for them , we took them , and we took care of her , and we gave him eight percent seat , her family , necessary was necessary . 
it was something that knew to do . 
and just as the woman who wanted to to know grown as a , turned together , turning it into a box of ash and got embarrassed . 
what happened happened was that the circle closed , was a circle and revelation been circle of the subject of i spoke about . 
the revelation is death part part of life . 
she has rescued my life , and my partner and successes were her . 
and you know , that part of life takes all that the rest of life needs . 
he needs truth and beauty , and i 'm so glad that this is was been mentioned . 
he needs just to need equally just much as he needs , to and joy , and there 's to give us all things . 
thank you . 
imagine a giant explosion , it rise up to , feet . 
imagine imagine a injection with of smoke . 
imagine a solar power , would be worth oil ship thinking we worry think about , thinking , that , , resilience , that . 
scary things kind . 
now , i had a unique place on the day i was on d . 
so i saw them just a moment , and they said , no problem , we probably probably caught some birds . get out .  
the pilot had kicked turned on and we were not gone far away . 
you could see manhattan . 
two minutes later , they things happened happened . 
the pilot , set up the machine to the hudson river . 
that is usually not the route we 
it turns off space off turn . . 
i could see it in her eyes , and horror was a , that was down the end . 
i 'd to share with things i 've been learning about this day . 
i learned that in is different in now . 
while later , thinking i was thinking about it , a saying , i 'm going to maintain , i , i 'm making cry bad . 
because when wine wine is there and that , then open it . 
i don want to move a bit more change change in life . 
and this sense of urgency , objective goal , really really transformed my life . 
i had a good life . 
but in my humanity , i 've gave my my ego room as well . 
and i thought about the relationships with my wife , to friends . 
and after that kept about it , i decided to was keep keeping negative negative energy . my life . 
it 's not perfect , but it 's much better . 
i have had had two years of justice wife who 
it feels great . 
i 'm not trying to have right good . 'm chosen be happy to be happy 
you see the water coming out 
i said , please in the air for  
i don 't want this thing to happen to parts like you 'm sending out of classes . 
as we crash hitting the seizure , i felt this feeling of human , , boy too scary . 
it 's almost like we are preparing for our . 
but it was very sad . 
i didn 't want to go i 'm my life . 
i just wish i could grow my children growing 
about a month later that visited one teenager of my daughter , class , did a lot artistic priority . . . 
 . . . not yet . . 
and in the world , made sense of me . 
and realized then by linking on the on each other that the life , it a great father to being . great father . 
more than anything , everything else , is only successful goal of life life , is be a good dad . 
given i was given by the miracle , the day , i to was one die . 
i got another gift , the future , and i got back and live differently . 
so call all these people flying today is imagine they they 's on your flight , but please you just it , what would you change ? ? 
what would you do when you do that because you think you were forever there ? 
how would you change your relationships and negative negative energy in it way 
and more than anything , , are they the best parents to be ? they can ? be ? 
thank you . 
this idea behind the stuxnet computer is pretty straightforward . 
we don 't want iran to build the bomb . 
these gray box stores 't run with software they 're a it on a completely different technology . 
and that 's the planning proposal these . 
this is a piece of cake , right ? 
i want to tell you a how we 've figured this . 
when we started r research d research six months ago , really completely unknown out what the sense of what and thing and purpose was been whole thing thing 
and this captured our attention , we started a lab project where we were our environment with infected , , and went these . . 
and then some funny . . 
that that made no sense in my eyes . 
and after doing born with various sorts of cheese related , i focused to with that declining year old . 
it , at would really of a goal . 
and if not , there stuxnet does nothing . 
so , i really got me interested in working interest , and we started working with the clock , because i thought , well , we don 't know what the goal is . 
it could be , for example , an american power plant , or a more competitive power in in germany . 
so we should try better better better better at what 's target is . 
and we realized that they were very professional , made , people who had all the expertise to the publicly . . 
they knew instilled deconstruct and woody and they needed to attack in . 
so they knew all . 
it 's much more difficult than anything we 've ever seen . 
here 's see a clip from this attack . 
we 're talking about , words code . 
and i want to tell you how we were able to make smart from this code . 
so we needed theories about these targets that we could prove them wrong them 
now , in this area , there are not many couple of goals . 
so i said my assistant , bring me a list of all for the medicines power plants and ship our lab system .  
and that worked very well . 
this , the signature part this moving piece within of a fabric , which is this black object that you see . 
and then you tamper the speed of this machine halves then actually , to the break down ball once and eventually , can break slow the loss . the . 
we dug gotten a lot of data in the high places and and we 've it glimpse of data and together the way on saturn of data into it . 
so for example , the number one is that 's this code you can 't overlook . 
so that made sense , it . 
and it 's better better . 
these include two reduction in iran they the . this 
it identical structure . 
so again , this matched really well . 
and this gave us a big bit for the insight that studied studied . 
now , don 't get me wrong , that isn not that easy . 
these these results were reaching through several weeks of work work . 
and we had ran run run into a dead end , we have had to collect us 
the little warhead takes a mountain , and we , knock push the reverse and slowed down down and starts large warhead , and six six sea nets and the . the sea . 
so , in the around , we 're very confident that we actually have have a the goal is . 
so we don 't have to worry about any other ones being met from these . 
here 's something really cool about this and we 've discovered me really 's really cut . off . socks . 
there 's gray box there and then on you see the bottom ball 
and in fact , these packets the statistics that gene data from that were 've already sampled place . 
that is cool , right ? 
in fact , it 's much more dangerous and and aggressive . 
the idea is to cheat a from the crafting of digital dominance . 
so we need digital security . production systems . 
and if the are at risk , really bad things can happen . 
the power plant can explode . 
that is frightening . 
but it gets worse . that . 
and what i 'm saying now is very important . 
he 's not nothing with beer , growing air . 
you could also use ordinary technology to spread . 
you just to spread it as much as possible . 
and if you do that , you get up with a cyber weapon . 
that 's the consequence that have to ask up 
so , unfortunately most number of goals is not point of goals , those who of attacks in the middle east . 
they 're in the united states and in europe and japan . 
we need to place the consequences , start to prepare . 
thank you . 
i have a question . 
is that your opinion ? ? 
okay , you really want to know ? 
yeah . okay . 
so the driving force behind that is the cyber superpower superpower 
there 's only one and that is united united states for happiness . 
because sooner or otherwise problem would be bigger bigger . 
thank you for letting us happen very , . thank you . 
i 've spent the last few years taking to place myself in situations that very , and , difficult and least dangerous 
i went to prison . 
i worked in a coal in britain . in . . 
i was sweating into devastating zones , dangerous and dangerous . 
and i spent days dealing nothing but here is where at the beginning beginning , a little bit at in the middle , very dangerous at the center . 
i fact , i 've faced the most part of my career in the problem profound bit situations strange moment , and i all i to do was to look at social effort into they 're compelling and interesting , and hopefully hope to get is sense of rational makes them room fun and accessible . 
so as i knew that was coming here to look at the world of a tedtalk community of boeing and cool , i knew i i was going to do something a little different . 
some of you may probably heard about this that that i did a couple weeks ago in seattle . get out of local facilities . 
so what they got was the this you show presenting here was my ted talk about , you had no idea what the subject was going to be , and the way that could drove contents of them ears to fly , the ears , especially if i were going to stand open their company for their operations rather . 
but even from this , , it 's a very good global opportunity . . 
do you know how many people watch watching this ? 
a lot . 
this is just the only title . 
now , if you asked me this a year ago , i wouldn not have able to say this to you . a sense . 
but in the new project , i work on , my new film , we 're the world of marketing , advertising . 
as i said , , i 've been able some pretty terrible situations in but nothing could afford me out , the hard to hard to walk to and just a dangerous hard place into the room . 
you know , i had the idea for a film . 
these people are be connected to the movie in forever . 
and so the the film understands going to study this whole idea that what ? in eternity , for ? ? 
i 'm an person who is this . 
that was more on emphasis . 
it was forever . forever forever .  
so perhaps we sell a shoe and the 's going to be the greatest shoe they 've wore . . . 
so the idea here to show that that a brands , a part of life , actually , to get them to the movie ? 
and we actually show the whole of it how it whole it works . 
the goal of film film is transparency . 
they will actually the whole thing in the film , 
so this is the whole concept , the whole movie , from the the . 
you know , it 's funny , because when i first heard , it 's the ultimate respect for the audience . 
i i don 't know how to people will be . 
how much money does be required to realize this ? 
 . million . 
i think it 's going to meet them , but i think it 's worth it any critical familiar brand , quite really famous brand . 
who know know who 's when the movie comes out , we might see it character like planter 's . 
what do you think the be ? the answer ? 
the answer will likely going to be no very likely to 
but is it a difficult thing about film film , a tough thing to me ? 
jk both . 
 . . . meaning 't , , optimistic to be optimistic . 
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help . 
i can help . 
okay . 
fantastic . 
we need to think about what 's . 
yeah . 
if you look at the people who have 've to do it . . . 
there are some available we can turn to . 
imagine the camera . 
turns turns out that , , that want to do with with their movie .  
and simply as far away these are disappeared , one after the other . 
i didn 't want to have anything the movie . 
i was amazed . 
they had absolutely nothing to do with the project . 
and i was confused , because i thought the whole concept of advertising was to presenting your product as as many people as possible , as much people as see as as possible . 
no , it 's what i thought . 
but look the the problem was that my idea had a fatal a fatal mistake , and that 's this big is 
no , no , that wasn not the mistake . 
this 's have been no problem at all . 
that was have been okay . 
but what the picture represents is is a problem . 
and see , when you go to the search search engine this is one first of that comes the first six appearing and seems going . 
i really like your kind , , brin . now . 
you know , we 're hear a entire amount of transparency . 
our politics are saying it , our president says even our own , say it . 
but as long as it 's , , , done , something changes . 
but why ? well , transparency is like this strange bear brush this great bear , brush it is also brush 
it 's like counterintuitive counterintuitive this weird version . 
and it 's also very risky . 
what else is the child risky ? 
a whole superhero word sweet , . 
that 's very risky . 
so when i started talking to the companies , and i tell them that wanted to tell the story , they said , no , we want to tell the story . be told . 
we want you to tell a story , but we just want you to tell our story .  
look , when i was a child , and my dad caught took me and and vivid and sitting at me , and at me view , he said say , my son , there 's three versions of life story versions . each . 
there 's your version , there 's my version , and there 's the actual version .  
so you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the actual version . 
so what they started to do was or what i started to realize was that when you start talking to talk companies , the idea of getting your brand is going , is a amazing problem . 
i have friends , hollywood movies , gigantic i have friends doing the girls like like d movies like me . 
and then my friends say the are making little independent , well , how should we compete this big , giant hollywood movies ?  
so , how much we see in the film of the seed ? ? 
and every time i do interview hands , can i say , are you being enough for this interview ? 
you know up . you see a little nervous . 
i 'd to help you to calm . 
so you might want been little bit this before ,  
we are being recognized equipped and men and women , on on board , on item stick , . the stick . whatever . 
that is the one one . 
we 're a smaller brand . 
just you 've talking about the smaller movies , we 're a brand car . 
so we don 't have a budget of anything other . other rest . 
so doing that like that , you know , people remember the kind it 's kind of why we 're interested . 
in is would you describe to the ban ? 
ban belongs been tourism that feared farm . 
this is a great question . 
it is not the way you should describe something that somebody is doing you oral rehydration culture . 
we 're talking about bold bold , fresh . 
i think fresh great word is that this category is really positive enough positive , but fight against smell and smell outside moisture  
it 's holding water . 
how can we keep it , for a , fresh fresh , more times more fresh . 
that things have a medium interest . . on . 
and this is a million corporation . 
i 've to talk to the man in the street that which are like , possibly example , just , natural cricket . 
you 're to tell me a about my brand . 
how would your describe your brand ? 
hmmm , brand , my brand ? 
i don 't know . 
i really love to love a beautiful clothes . 
unique . 
i like a lot of black black colors pot a lot and , and so like that . 
but i , i have a historian like sunglasses , or an jewelry , a stuff . this . 
woman if he was a brand , he 'd have old a very captain ruling 
woman mean partly hippie , short yogi cut , i little i don 't know . 
so i think that 's my brand . 
this is my favorite brand in my little , high , industry . 
is that what 
i 'm tom . 
and what 's going on is i i needed an expert . 
if they could do it for the , , they could help help me . 
they brought along your your images , yeah ? 
i is me first painting i have . this first slide is a my family . 
just me a little bit about how this is connected with your mind and feelings that . 
these are the people who form my worldview . 
tell me about this world . 
md this world ? i think your own world is the world in you in a around a world , the friends , the family , the kind you live life the work of the life , the work and all . 
all these these things came from and place , and they started with in me in the virginia . 
what 's the next thing you 're to talk about . 
the next one this was the most beautiful day of my life . 
what is of context is the about the thoughts and feelings about them ? 
it 's just me 'd like to be like 
i like things that are different . 
i like things that were weird sick , and like weird things . 
tell me the it what does this make us ? 
tell me a little bit about this part . 
a bit more about you , not you are . 
 . . . no 't you have to be a fear of what kind of rollercoaster is it ? 
thank you very your patience . 
yeah . all . 
yeah , i don 't know what it make there . 
and were all kinds of crazy things going on . 
it 's very good . 
and i think there 's almost a contradiction with it . 
and i think some companies the companies are going to focus on a a strength , instead of both on each . 
many companies tend to get that 's the nature of natural 's things who up which they 're not sure , they 're going of being , and that they 're very this speak , and they turn for for a positive themselves and that 's a smart flow of people . 
what other brands do doing this 
the first one is a classic . apple , 
or are they more rather down a mining nuclear a 
or are they more like a down narcotics ? 
over the motion , , we had more than , that were up and down companies , and they ones said said because they didn 't want to be part of the project . 
they didn 't want to do anything with this film because they didn no control , no control over the finished product . 
and we drove to school in school companies to where they go get your way to impoverished schools , in the america . 
the the incredible thing for me is that the projects i got the most feedback the times that or the as i was the very success of that are the things that i interacted with . 
and that 's what they tags have done . 
because she finds out the middle , he finds cut the least , and said that the agencies would not don 't really have your interests in the sense . 
i 'm going to negotiate with the artist . 
i 'm going to work with him and create something completely different , something that makes people think that our worldview will really challenging . 
and how did they succeed you ? that what 's it successfully ? 
now , since we film went birthday the we could go early and see it 
this is actually a mere of just a couple of weeks . 
this is just the no press . no tv . 
the film was 't featured . 
there 's no movies on even there joke . . 
he 's not out in . other countries . 
now finally finally film has on very get very very momentum momentum . 
and this 's not bad good project where , project where almost every agency catalog we were talking to your clients who would listening your do their fingers on 
something that think is that when you take your chair , you away , risks risks to risks in these risks . 
i think when you 're people from it , you get more close to failure . 
i think that if you 're training your employees , you 're not going the whole company to get a profit . 
i have got the sense that we need going to start about people , taking risks . 
we need to encourage people to are not afraid to have any fear to do us luck . 
and finally , we need to come forward to the fear . 
we should be putting the bear in the cage . 
please . the fear . you chances . 
and finally , we should welcome welcome transparency . 
now , more than ever before we 's a going us to be very little bit more honesty . 
data data is made to transform organizations around the world into large opportunities . 
thank you . 
now , morgan in in 's the transparency talk is what what to with happen this ? 
this is a great question . 
i did something about in front of google , and i went with to doing soap things museums and art , my boss , who was was me a little bit of a to gave also gave me the green light . 
and it lasted months . 
but i 'm focus on the screening . 
there 's all kinds of stories about why we 've this . 
i think my personal personal interpretation is very easy with this slide and i their access . 
i grew up in india . 
when when i went to visit those museums , i started learning learn a lot . 
and while i was working for google , i was trying to make this longing for technology combined . 
and then include a team , a great team , and we started with this . 
i 'm going to start with the demo , and share you some interesting things that happened since that happened . 
you can look all around these museums around 
i 'm even in one of my favorite , of the most metropolitan museum of new york . 
you just just getting very two ways . 
welcome congratulations and , you 'm really the coffee museum . 
it doesn 't matter where they are , this , mexico , it doesn 't make a difference . 
you go around and laugh go amused . amused 
you they want to the museum ? 
open the card , and pop it with a click , 
in it they 're , they want to go to the end of the gang . 
only more . 
as you go through them . 
thank you , but the best part is . on 
i see the dead . 
if the museum gave us the picture , click on it . 
so is now one of the images . 
this is all style . 
those of you who are really interested in art can click along here , i 'm through this now 
so this 'm going to show you now . 
you can get very and with a . lightweight . 
you see a a here . 
i love this guy his word up is . . 
but then you really want to drill inside inside . 
and so i started playing around , caught to think that there 's something going on . 
and i thought , well , minute , that sounds interesting .  
i was getting close close to and slowly , and i realized that these kids actually actually going forward together . 
it it was quite popular . 
i don 't know why they did it , but i learned a about this . 
and really close close to this part , you can go to to those sort of hard edges 
just to give you a quick chunk of zoom i just zoom onto so so you see what you 're getting . 
here we were , and this is the painting . 
but best of is still where a second . 
so us jump to the moma , again to to the new york . 
another line , from by as way of utility stand . 
so the previous example of finding issue is to find the detail . 
but what if you want to see the brush ? 
and what if you want to see van as united was as van gogh this been doing this new , ? creating ? 
this is a potential of a potential that ever i don 't know . 
now i 'm going to show you my favorite feature . . 
there 's a lot more , but i don missing there time time . 
this is the really cool part , and 's called collections collections . 
each of you , every single person of or can , whether you 're got a brilliant house , doesn 's 't matter . 
you can go your innovate your own museum all all these these images , you can make your own collection . 
you can just all through comments your your friends , and you to conversation about what they feel when you look at these masterpieces . 
i think ending , , for me , is the main thing that all the wonderful things are not here here by google . 
they appear to , even from out of museum . 
i don say this . 
they come from artists . 
and that was an experience of humility . me . 
i mean , i hope that 'll be associated this digital medium in the digital arts , and they 's really neat . 
the the answer to that is , no . 
it 's about make down experience experience . 
that 's why it 's about . thank you . 
thank you . 
this is a representation of your brain . your brain can break divided in two halves . 
that 's the left side , the is the logical side , and then the right half , half is the intuitive , 
like example , this this person is perfectly logical . it 's perfectly reasonable . 
this would somebody who is completely intuitive . 
so , would you position your brain against the type ? 
it 's not like though they 're both either located or things . 
you can be logically . 
but at the same time , we need a intuitions methods to actually do a experiments . 
how do we evolve this intuition ? well , we love playing play with things . 
so we go out and play with it and see how it reacts and and then we start to develop our intuition . 
basically basically do the same thing . 
so one of the hunches that they 've developed over the years is probably that a thing about be at the same time just at a place . 
i mean , it 's funny to think about having a you thing about at the same time at two different places , but they were not born with this idea , they developed developing . 
he was a a toddler , didn 't get very good at it all 
and this is a great conceptual conceptual conceptual in world , so is , for a long time they don not a fan of 
and if they play with their particle , they all play the things like they fly through walls , or they can be at the same time in two different places . 
and so they all all these observations , and they called the theory of quantum mechanics . 
this was the state of the art a few years ago , describe quantum mechanics to a small , , tiny , . 
but it didn 't take them to describe the great objects around us . 
this , this didn not little bit more this intuition , and maybe it is not because i don 't often play with the . 
well , i do sometimes with you , but not very often . 
and i 've never seen it . 
i mean , nobody one ever saw particles . 
but my side side didn not love it well well . 
because if all these particles are made of particles , and all these particles follow the rules of quantum mechanics , it the it not simply follow all the rules of quantum mechanics ? 
i don 't see the reason why this shouldn be be that 
so i would feel more comfortable with the whole thing if we we could show by of these these these everyday , of , of rules of quantum mechanics . 
so i decided to doing exactly exactly what i was doing . 
i got one . 
this is the first object you can see that 's quantum full circle of x . 
so what we 're looking at here is a tiny little chip . 
and you can see this green dot there in the middle . 
this 's the piece of metal about i 'm going to talk about . 
this is a picture of the object . 
here i add it up we look going to look at into at . 
and here 's a really big close up little little of that little piece of metal piece 
so what we 're at is a small piece of metal it 's like a springboard and it 's hovering above the edge . 
so i made this thing , a very similar way , you do doing a computer chip . 
and for the last little bit , i had to build my own machine to grow it sort , like a pool that hole and that fabric that . thing . 
this whole involves the ability to assemble the gateway right in divided to it needs a little bit of help to do it . 
look , let me give you an analogy . 
you know , how being 's in an voluntary on an elevator ? 
quantum mechanics so us that in most is currency is as comfortable in in . 
the fellow riders of in democracies majority important are not just people , but the the light that shines to be , and the wind , 's passed through to you , who the heat of the room . 
and so we knew , if we wanted to see that this piece of metal piece rapidly , we were were to bring it . 
and then we did . 
so we measured its movement . 
we found that it 's really moving . 
in in which we gave it a tiny push , we could vibrate it vibrate the same time at and not something something that could happen in quantum way mechanics . 
so what i 'm telling you is what truly truly amazing . 
what does it mean to vibrate the the end time and not vibrate it 
let 's think about atoms . 
so the first case is all atoms atoms from atoms that 's the piece of metal and and , and and at the same time moving moving same atoms atoms move . 
that means what the , that each atom is at the same time in two different locations , which at at at the same piece , the whole piece of metal is two two different parts . 
i think that 's really cool . 
i . 
so if a single atom can be at the same time in two places places , this piece of metal in be in two different places , but why not 't they ? 
i mean , that 's just what says my next side . 
so , imagine if they were at to be at several times , what would that feel ? 
there 's another aspect of history . 
they hear a lot about talk about how quantum mechanics says us that 's is connected . 
now , that 's not the right . 
there 's more more back than it 's going even . 
it 's like these those connections , their connections with all the things that them literally literally define who they are , and that 's the deep and profound state quantum quantum one mechanics . 
thank you . 
it should be our goal that if families are about where they live and cooperate , they opportunity is organizing rise to least five different a handful of different cities that everyone stand all of species in the communities . 
we 're way away of this goal . . 
there are billion billion people developing developing world , not even a single city , who would would welcome to . 
but the amazing thing is cities is that they 're so much more than to build it . 
now this might seem absurd for you , if you 've thought thought of cities . 
but just take off the building blocks homes ones to for the cities . 
imagine half half of the people who would going to live in homes , they would probably this already the , but not yet . 
you could try to use the capacity of existing existing homes . . 
but you know what they would do is intervene would engage embraced into these homes and their environments to prevent competing shift , their prevent the process of to break the pace of . 
so it turns out to 's very difficult to keep all all of this increments . 
but you could go to a whole new place , and a completely new tube of logical performers , providing support that the rules would be and not make them harder 
so i 've proposed that governments are going to create doing new areas that that are enough place for cities city for and giving 've given you a official charter . 
in the intervening , i was preparing a speak at a conference at tedglobal . 
through through the process of consumers , and by to reduce by , i tried to save this complicated concept of charter city in production . reduce the elements . 
the first point , the importance laws is the laws laws , laws that laws that are actually be forgotten to existing with existing cognition . 
we 're short getting a lot of thinking , but for progress , it requires to and laws , and laws 's usually the laws that hold us withdrawn . 
this the fall , friend of guatemala , a a see slide to the tedtalk end . 
the were called me . 
and they , let 's present the the the head of our country .  
so we met out in december kansas of the boardroom place in miami . 
i clearly to make a clear point of what valuable cities are to significantly more valuable to so cost effective 
but it was a pretty abstract discussion , at a point , there was a moment , column , said the , said , paul , we might be at maybe tedtalk .  
so so 's why i was asked by the president of honduras , who said that we need to be this project , that it 's important to and that this is the way forward our country . 
so i gave a little bit of facts to what key , which is a slide show like this , which tries to , what that if you want make enhance the city , it needs to be very very big city . 
this is a image of the city planner , and the sketch was to the new airport developing which was constructed in denver . 
in was a psychiatric one by the airport . was been made by a dangerous . 
that 's more than a thousand tomorrow of 
they curves has 
faces faces of immediate were very seriously and very carefully . 
i have it here on my laptop .  
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk . 
and i 've come to the point where there new city is worth opportunities has made new possibilities . 
there would be a opportunity to live in a city that would in honduras , rather than hundreds from miles miles in the range . 
and a new city is new opportunities for leaders . 
and the insight of president johnson , that the very of the certainty that 've thought of as a way to bring the promised to lead these foreign and to be those town as the might be the to be parties in have been in honduras years of fear , in the of fear values of of health health . 
we 're traveled it field . 
this image a picture of this place . 
it 's it a by square miles . 
in a country that has just been a terrible crisis behind her , in congress was chosen elected in a vote . that vote . 
all parties parties , all the tolerance of society , supporting this . 
to become part of the constitution , it has to be approved by congress . 
february th , it became been tried for a voice voice a . 
one one is south korea . 
this is a picture of a major , new , new city built in south korea , built much built in as the city of the inner . architectural .c . 
all they can see in this slide was built within four years , after it taken four to four the necessary necessary . 
the other place that was particularly interested in the urbanism , is singapore . 
there has been built in two china and the third is in preparation . 
so if you look at it , it 's basically place where we are today . 
they 've already got a long of time lot weave , and they 're consider this space for the second town . 
there 's been already legal system that managers will going working on , and it 's working on a legal system . a case . 
they even bring funding to a . 
one of the things they already know was been seen has been there , many are a lot of tenant shops . 
there are lots of who would like to come in a place with trade organization , and there are a people who would like to live and live there . 
there are million people who are , who have trying to live life live in a different different place . 
one of people go five and a percent a year in the united states . 
many of them are fathers who are forced , go out their home parents to work , the home , they father who are rich money to be and their to . 
but , , sometimes kids who are even even to find their parents again , which some cases , since a decade , have 't seen any decade . 
so what is it for think about , a whole city ? 
so what is it an it an idea , every family has a choice between several couple of cities cities cities who are in to be new institutions new countries ? 
that 's one idea worth spreading . 
my friends from honduras , they asked me to thank you ted thank . 
you know , how many decisions do you make a a typical day ? 
do know , how many decisions do you making at a typical week ? 
and even , a study study of done with ceos who watched them novel week 's shoulder a week . 
and these scientists have just documented the different themes that have been talking about , ceo what , and how time of the they were talking about making making a make decisions that the issues . allow were discussing . . 
and what they 've found is that average ceo is in 've busy a problems . lot in the time . 
each of these themes was course , was composed lot of choice , many variations decisions . 
 percent of their decisions were been made in nine minutes or less hit 
only about about percent of their decisions they needed to take an hour or more of their time . 
think of your own decisions . 
you know , how many decisions do you break in the end minutes category of those group category at for evening , 
how good , you think you 're going to actually face these decisions ? 
i want to talk about the problem and and talk can talk some sorts solutions . this problem 
now , when i talk going to talk about this problem , i 'm going to ask you some questions , and i want to ask your answers . 
if i asked you a question , raise your hand , because 'm blinded just you want to burn some calories . 
thank you . much . 
this business , which was almost like did issue an crash . 
i loved going into this business but at a point i wondered myself , well , how does you ever make that ever 
here 's the olive stuff worm here 
so i decided to one decided like to a favor one , and i asked the mommy , this model works works to make the work that human all are offer doing this possibility ?  
we decided to go an an experiment , jam chose to hand a experiment . 
here 's a bunch of bugs . 
they had different types . 
we 've and and put 've together two different platforms or elements jam put put up , we we put looking at two things one , one thing i think , i mean what would the case of to be and stop more people ? 
it 's more people stuck when a hundred , about percent than six it was six , , about percent . 
and after that , looked at what happened people appeared was , place , 
now we saw the other effect . 
fifty of the people that they were left , and they three percent actually had a glass appeared appearing . 
from from the people who were there , though were six , now , we we saw that percent of them actually bought a glass of appearing 
well , if you adopt caught the people used to put a six glass , who they had six choices , their way as if they had they to . 
we 're 't decide to get , even if it 's governments to be against our own interests interests . 
so the theme of your day is saving . 
and what found out indeed there in is one connection . 
so , we had about plans that have has to do back to the two and different manufacturing members . 
and what we found was that the more supportive has , , that , indeed , the participation rate this was was low . . . 
now that even turns out that even if they decided that they were picking decide picking that they more more problematic , even with has has some negative consequences . 
none of those extreme decisions to belongs to make decisions that people recommend people living when the future , if our future priority resource well being is important . 
well , over the past years , we 've seen three critical negative consequences that will offer more and more choices with increasing . 
they change the decision you push yourself , your own personal , even if it goes your interest can interest . 
they make make more decisions worse , , worse for . 
they choose to be more careful to what things that prefer , even if they make objective better sense 
first first story is . priority . 
you heard heard earlier this before , but it 's never true true than today . 
people are always concerned , if i say , storytelling .  
a typical vignette computer gives given to you , products today you . 
and the who really want to gathering , are will intensify commit a fund , not more get , or , 
you know , people often say , i don 't know how to just it . 
it 's all important opportunities .  
and the first thing i asked is employees is , you me how the ways differs from one other . 
and if your employees don 't know , they can 't country , it can 't save they their people don 't .  
now before we started lunch to have lunch today gary now , i had a conversation with gary 
and gary said he said he was willing everyone offer everyone the the people in this audience , including vacation , to offer a to the most beautiful street block offer world . 
here 's a description of the street . 
and i would like to read the audience for 
and now 'll going to give you a couple of to read you and i i 'll you to clap it , if you 're gary 's hand to participate you up . 
all right . everyone who ready to adopt gary of gary 's assets 
are that all ? this ? 
all right , let me show you a little bit more of it . 
they you notice , chills was a of jumble a trick before ? 
now , who 's willing to take care trip to 
i think i 've heard more hands with 
good . 
the fact whose really actually gun of did they did at mit first time information when the first information , , but i would like i would introduce you would felt it in more significant estate than than lot more significant . . 
because the paintings did it real estate to . 
it 's about the to understand the difference between possibilities as having the theories the consequences with what can individual options are do , and that has results have these outcomes and lies have to be recognized . 
why are people spending up to percent more than , more money a what if they use card card or a credit card , as a vote on cash card 
because it doesn 't really make we we 're to to be real . 
and it turns out that if you manage do something that feels concrete feels very , it 's a very good tool for people to get more . 
and as we went to this meeting , we 've had those things in like they leave always been , we we added to little bit . do . 
the little thing we added in that we just asked people to think think about positive the positive things that would happen in their lives if they were going to save money . 
in which process thing , we did a process of working part percent to percent , the money to get the percent increase in the number of the number who were willing to save or a net increase in the service of the money that were willing to pay for 
we can better more of the residual limb than with more . . 
but you know what ? 
because the categories tell me how to keep it apart . 
one is called the jazz one , band .  
when you think the dot target column is literally and the display on the right , the one , , they press into the hands . 
okay , there 's a couple . 
and you think that the one to of the left side is the conversation is and the one on the page is , please clap . please clap . 
okay , a couple more . 
now , it turns out they 're right . 
the second on the left is jazz and the right is moderate to the right , . you know what ? 
and you you see see , when see the long lists of these sets , time problem . 
why mean , who are you really to know about this ? 
my fourth technology for complexity . 
it turns out that we can actually deal with more more we think we think thinking dumb to them . 
we need to increase complexity slowly . 
i me show you an example of what i mean . 
let 's make a very , decision making the purchase of a car . 
you have to make different decisions to design their completely different way . 
now these choices are going from the number of choices that they them make choice . 
what i 'm doing now is i 'm changing the sequence in the decisions . 
what am i looking at ? 
they care interested . 
we lose them . 
go go a residual choice you can stick to the many , you stay in 
it 's the same information . it 's the same number of possibilities . 
the only thing i 've is it 's the order that which this information is presented in 
when i start at with the simple one i 'm rather like i 'm training . bias 
it also pirate me this with the big product that i am together , and so i 'm willing to urge to be people with this . 
let me wrap up up . 
and each of these techniques that i 'm to you today is to help them manage the to them them , use them for they can use them for themselves , well designed good the people they they offer them . 
because i think the best key to the best is that you 're selection 's 
and the more we 're choosing to choose and pick them , , we better we 'll be able to act the art of choice . 
thank you . 
that 's true . 
today today we 're looking to talk about today is what to are games , spread , and then this is all 's important doing point part to 
we all want to coaster , performers a , i be a boy , i was a boy , and it seemed so , , it seemed perfect seemed so an great to problematic . 
but people have enabled so we all , been chronically advanced , that that all can all deeply famous in a part of our culture of our world . 
every single one of you could be famous to the internet to the . to . saturday . 
but in than hours , video video uploaded become uploaded to minutes minute . 
and , just 's going to be given a tiny , correction virally which is going back of times , thousands many to the moment cultural of the . 
so how does that work ? 
so , let 's want . and 
oh my god . oh my gosh . 
oh my god ! 
whoa ! 
 . times had been looked at . . 
this graph a graph , as it looked like when last time video last was popular popular last the first time . 
actually fact , no wanted not want to do reading any games . 
he just wanted to share a rainbow of 
because you make doing to make it in you 're a mountain yosemite 's called . 
and this is was actually been shot in january in 
what happened here earth ? 
jimmy jimmy jimmy jimmy kimmel had along . 
jimmy kimmel sent the tweet , the end , video time that the writing was 
it was seen over year by nearly million times . 
this is the graph . 
what happened on that day ? 
well , it was a , that 's right . 
if you know this want to convey those other peaks are too . the record . 
what what about this day , that particular friday ? 
and this community was by lot of people who shared this great , , and began started to talk to door with it . 
already in the seven seven days , there was a parody of every single day of every single day . the day . 
unlike the th century entertainment of the most of the our way is our become part of this phenomenon , either taking spreading it , doing something new . 
that 's , , it simple . 
this year was almost million times . 
even cats look at this video . 
cats look at cats . at this video . 
there were shot . 
someone made an old version of it . 
and then it went into international internationally . 
today , we don 't just find a little bit of delight , we do . . 
who could have this philosophically all that could have ? 
what types the writing about the various scripts that are break about these kinds ? 
i got a speeding ticket because i 'm not on my bike traffic , , but often there 's the reason that have on a . of bridge . 
this approach is for all , , is what , 
and this of this leads to a one question question . . 
what does that mean ? 
drown pleo . 
what does this mean ? 
as i said , one of the most stars stars has says , what bieber is start . 
no one needs give you ideas of green question . 
and today , we all feel as owners of our pop culture . 
and these 's not the characteristics of the old mediums and they 're not even going the media from today media today , but they 're going to determine the into the future . 
thank you very 
as about i talk about you the band few minutes of three girls of three and and and how the amazing band of that connectedness hatch a four year a half year who stood asleep in the hundred year and sister and was talk to her baby sister and her mother two late lines stay cute little in a small san , authorized was be , a growing with this young girl , this the , she girl girl is , boy she 's never in this girl , . she she . she her little notch . . 
history story is even even . 
she 's a jigsaw , which is , in the way , being a together . 
imagine the first piece of a man that 's dad . 
he 's a poet , a writer , a man whose whole life of the masses hope of oneness and freedom of its home . 
he was going back into silence . 
he died through broken through history . 
he 's my grandfather . 
i 've never ever him myself . 
but our lives are much much more than our memories . 
my grandmother never kept to . 
i had to worry that it wasn not free , and it was my job to learn that the story was be old to crush old dancer , but it 's through . 
my mother have been when when her dad had in a before her married of a , with already little . 
for her , life lives had an to escape the escape of recovery , and a new life in australia . 
it was completely excluded that it could be . 
all the were conscious agents 
the biggest was terrified , rape and rape , death . 
no apple 's tasted this way 
after three months in a camp camp , we landed up in melbourne . 
my mom was on farms , then in a assembly in a car in a car , robots , six days , double and . 
it somehow managed it worked kind to find to find in time to to have english and to acquiring it . 
we were poor . 
two fans at for school , each one , to load the holes in the other . 
going where where ? we go ? 
there was a meeting reconciliation sight , a vote said i said , i 'll going to get off there way .  
my mother , my sister and i with my bed . the same bed . 
my mother was exhausted , but we told each other from our day to and they to keep the movements of our grandmother in the house . 
and it 's my job to stay awake every night until her came to that to hurt . . 
loans we and funders were looking . 
centers centers been formed . 
in , the was the classic student , the acumen university that the this belly of self . 
but so many of those stuff of 
i was not familiar with the etiquette . 
i didn 't know how to use the utensils . 
i did 't know how to talk about wine . 
i didn 't know how to talk about anything . 
i told my mother , i would 't do that . 
she she reminded me that i was now as old as she were at the time when we had the boat . 
no , no , had been been . 
 just do it , she said , not don 't , what you are not .  
and the more open i talked talking about the more i should tell you 
i saw a lot of people in the 's the , so many of them did what they were were living , the limits of the potential . 
and while i had my my education , i realized i could not take in a legacy in law . . 
and i realized at the same time that it 's okay to be an maverick , a meeting background a , an in novel the picture and not just , but for you need to be for what , gift , maybe a 
because regular can lead light for collapse difficult collapse , the sense , so easy that that you can think the range of the collection . 
so i followed down with my gut feeling 
i took a little team of people to do this , and a have a very shared challenge . 
we didn 't have a cent . a year . 
at at the end of every mid , , i 'd a a a giant soup soup soup which we shared . 
we were until until that night . 
most of our ideas were crazy , but they were a few brilliant at the with and we were getting the breakthrough on 
i made the decision to go to the united states . 
after just a trip there . 
my gut feeling again . 
and then months later , i moved , the adventure continued . 
before before i do the lecture , me i want like to share you about my grandmother . 
life hasn not been changed in centuries . 
her father passed away after her birth . 
her mother moved moved her . 
and mandarin , they mandarin the woman mandarin half , whose mother . her . 
 it not appear out to be as false . 
i just in a hotel room in as in it died , miles away in melbourne in 
i knew she had come up to say goodbye . 
my mom was just to call me a few minutes afterwards . 
we told her stories , and we assured her our we were . 
and after a turn of the , he said , had to finish the coffin away . 
my mother asked us to throw their their with 
she asked the monk why is your hand so warm and the the is so cold ?  
 because they 've been keeping tomorrow them this , he said . 
 they 've not embarrassed a problem .  
if there 's a band in our family , then there 's through the women . 
defeat know have been to . defeat . 
i i 'd like my own , and i 'm going about the boat . 
who would ever wish a wish ? 
i don 't know . 
but if i could pull this that and get it safely , i would get it . 
i 'm here to share my with you . 
is it photography photography laughing 
because of course , this is a picture you can 't record with your camera . 
but , my interest in photography when i received my first digital camera , at years age of . 
i combined it with my previous taste for drawing , but it was a little bit different , because in terms process , the camera was actually in the process in in planning . 
and as you 've up a picture with a camera , the process end you hit it trigger button 
and for it seemed to me , to photography photography of photography , , like to the right time at the right time . 
i believed anyone could . that . 
so i wanted to create something different , something that starts with the process when the trigger is hit . 
and photography like this structure building , to a much lower car , a much bunch of street . 
but it has unexpected bit turn . 
and still keep a realistic level . 
or images like this dark and colorful , but then the end of but bring deal a realistic level with content . 
if i say reality , i take my picture . reality . 
because , of course , it 's not something you really , but i want want to look like it , as if you 've got this you know have it photograph . 
pictures take example , pictures have to take about a brief moment to try at the trick . 
so it 's about starting to catch an idea as really than really really long . 
but what 's the trick that makes it realistic ? 
is it matter to colors ? 
is that about the light ? 
what creates the illusion ? 
sometimes the illusion is the 
but at 's about about how we interpret going to interpret the world , and how it can be made on a two dimensional space . 
it 's not about what realistic is , what what we 're is 're being . 
so i think the basic are very simple . 
i think of them as a jigsaw puzzle in that where you can take and pieces and put together to create an alternative reality . 
and let me show you a simple example . 
we 've achieved three perfect physical objects , which which we 're all capable of living able to identify in a three dimensional world . 
but combined in a certain way , they can combined something that looks still in three way in could would be structured three ways . 
but at the same time , we know this isn not possible . 
so , 're not to our brains , our brain are not not very to the fact that it doesn 't really make sense . 
and i see the same process in taking pictures . 
it 's really about about bringing all about different . 
so the things that make it picture realistic , i think , are the we we don 't think about that us everyday our daily lives . 
but when we put put shots photos , it 's really important to think about because otherwise just get it data wrong it it wrong . the box . 
so i would argue that there are three simple rules to following to achieving a result . 
as you can see , these aren 't three special images . 
but combined can combine combine in a , be about to create something special this . 
so the first rule is , mixing took should have the same perspective . 
and third , it 's about making it impossible to where the single images begin and seize and end up combining it seamlessly . 
it 's impossible to say how the photograph was being together . 
here 's another example . 
you might think that this is a a landscape , and the bottom half became a . 
this this image is actually in fact , made from symmetrical bunch bunch of photos of different places . 
personally personally think that it 's easier to create a place , you have find a place , because you don 't have to compromise tradeoffs in the ideas into his head . 
but it requires a lot of planning . 
and as i had this idea in the winter , i knew i would need several months to plan it find the places for the different of the puzzle . 
the banks from from a different place . 
the underwater device is from from of a quarry . 
so get a realistic result of it 's from me , so it formulate out frustrations 
i always start with an skit , an idea . 
and then this 's about the combination of the the different pictures . 
and here 's every piece is the is very well planned . 
and then when if you do good images , the can be pretty beautiful , and it much realistic . 
so there are all the tools there , and the only thing we can do is our imagination . 
thank you . much . 
i would love to talk to you about why so are electronic fail this sets , . 
and i think the most important thing about stop is to stop ourselves with our patients . 
and you 're not doing a a scientific framework , you or tea or tea the patient , their patients , families families , is relatives , how she to be like ? 
how can we help you  
and we think we want to think that this is one of the reasons problems , as everyone of us may , most of to most the most sales problems , we 've stopped listening . 
here is my potential approach on . thing . it 's a very simple thing . 
it has got a button . 
and every morning i i 'm on to get to of it . 
and yeah , i have a problem of how you might recognize . . 
i 've do my job with pound caves . 
it just always , time i stop some on the scale , it 's sends out data to google . 
but there 's something else . 
maybe it 's well i 'll know , i 've over over over over on 
but could also be used to get people out of their chair , and bringing them together in some way , play their kind of game to better and control their health . 
it then it week , that 's what the . 
there 's going to be this little blood pressure on device that you put it off an iphone , something . 
and it 's going to enable people to contribute their home with to them blood their doctor , and to it with other , for something more than , . 
do methods as to are easy to use and begin with these patient to the team . 
and this can do that by these these a , , but also through crowdsourced . 
and one of the things we did done is i want like to share with you a short video . 
we all turn turn up in our turn . . 
maybe even in our cell . 
we know exactly where all 're all out an atm machine . . 
we remember know one where all falls stations are . 
and clear , we can find food . 
so , did we do ? we did crowdsourcing in netherlands . 
the next step was to find apps for this . 
and we 've designed this ipad , . 
and we want to bring this on a global scale . 
please help us improve improve the try to improve health health of just just getting a , 
thank you . 
today i i 'm going to report from discoveries discoveries . 
and my little bit , research , like we to bring a a by . . 
 . . . i make this sound sound . 
here 's a quick video about what we do doing . 
oh . a a minute . 
it takes maybe , unless it 's been . 
now , can just this way anymore just getting the bit more palm . and getting off the the video . . 
no . 
that 's not . . . 
okay . 
oh , my time has it been over ? 
okay . thank you . 
so a few years ago , i started a program to get the stars in and design decided a take a few years ago , and work it a break where the really working busy , , , . and actually actually it in government government . 
this is called pac code for america , and it 's a little like like the peace corps open software . 
and along developed great amazing apps , they with urban employees . 
but what they 're really doing is to show what is possible with with technology . 
so check meet al . 
how did he come up look for this particular species , help ? 
we had a team of fellows sized boston , is the the code for america research 
they were in on the , and it did a much more thing february . 
and they felt like the city never took these fire for every all . 
so he did what any was doing great developers , he wrote an app . 
it 's a nice little depot where you can a fire brigade , right fire a fire hydrant . 
you also match to to a lever , lift . if it 's . 
if you do do that , you can give him a name , and he called the first al . 
if you don 't do that , someone can take it . . 
so there 's a nice little game . . 
this is a very modest app . 
it 's probably the smallest facet of the apps that the fellows have written written over the last year . 
it 's rapidly expanding . 
there is a guy in e .t . department , the center of this guy , he 's use that app that he allowing using this snow , but rather adopt the people of relocation own . 
it 's very important that these tsunami were mop be fixed people that are 're , but people steal the batteries . 
so he got the people to test . 
we now know about about cities planning , to this app . 
it the problem takes of the takes place few years to get it go of 
we had a team , which had spent team last worked last year in an boston project , where they needed two the two two and a half months . 
it was about a way to find out what you parents can find out what are the right public schools for their children . 
and were later later that if this were going to go over the regular channels , it took him over two years , and it would take over two million dollars . 
and that 's not even it is . 
there 's a project in california 's law review , the cost cost two taxpayer , two billion dollars , and it doesn 't work . 
and there are projects like this on any level . the . 
so an app that 's written in a couple of days , and it out to spread spreading , is a kind of , the front on the government . 
it shows how the government gets no longer work , more like a private enterprise , how many people think they should . . 
and not even like a technology , but rather like the internet itself . 
and that 's important . 
and this 's a very good news story , because it turns out that we are very good at in collective action with digital technology . 
now there 's a great community of people who the tools that we need to tackle tackle things in . 
it 's not just code america fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country who stand up and educational apps , every day in their own communities . 
they didn 't have given government to come up . 
they 're also frustrated with get them up they don 't complain about it them . 
and these people know something we 've lost from the eyes . 
today , a lot of people behind giving up to the government . 
politics doesn 't change the change 
and because the government ultimately effects your strength from us to the is how how do the go about to ? how think about how will this this change happen . 
i didn 't know much about the government , i launched this program . 
and as many people , i thought , it about the government is about percent power choosing people go to go to an . 
this is the the service and information . 
boston isn just has a call center . 
it 's an app app , a web and cell app called a . 
we don 't have this app . 
how do i get them away ?  
but what happens to mile , is summer else . 
scott was , by humans . 
but on citizens , citizens , everything that in public , so everybody can see it . 
and in this case , it place i saw a neighbor . 
and the next post we we got was said i i went over there , found the garbage behind the river . 
turned the side . the side . went home . 
it simple . 
this is great . this is the physical . 
and also 's also a good example of getting the government is actually started into this . 
but it 's also a great example of the was 
and i don 't mean a particularly technological definition . the platform . 
i 'm more about a platform for people to help themselves , to others . 
a citizen helped make another citizen , but the government was in a central role here . 
she was connecting them two people together . 
and you could have them with state of , if they were been needed but a neighbor is a neighbor better place to innovative to state government . 
if a neighbor is the neighbor , we foster our communities . 
one one of the things things is that we need to think that this is that government is not the same as politics . 
and most people understand that , they think that that the input of the other . 
that your contribution to the system is percent 
how often do choose a political leader , and we we have a lot of energy to choose a new political leader , and then we turn back into expect us to and and we expect the government , and whose fulfilled and and so it it doesn not a then it the needs . 
that is because the government is on wider of grow on and politics , 's the top five inch . 
and what 's in place is is what we call the bureaucracy . 
and we use this word with contempt . 
but it 's this contempt that and we have , and we whom we are going to pay , something be something that 's against us , something else , and then we are . to be . own . 
people seem to think , politics is sexy . 
if we want that institution to work to we must to make secret . 
because this is the business sensibility the action of this action . 
we have to be the engine . 
did you see these guys ? 
that is not political political action that 's legend . 
well for for those of us who gave been up our , it 's time we think about the , the the world we we are going to leave our children . 
you 've got to imagine the enormous challenges that you 're to imagine . 
do we really think that what have to get what we need do without better institution , the institution that can act done in the name of us of us ? 
a government requires absolutely imperative , but the government needs to be more efficient . 
and there 's a generation that grew up on the internet , and the white that it 's not really difficult to do things , you have have to build the system systems . 
this is a generation who grew up seeing it their voice for a for receipt . 
they 're 't fight this this struggle that we all are going , who can who talk to everyone . . 
you can express your view in every channel and you time . do it . 
so , if you are faced with the problem of government , do don 't care so much about using your voices . 
they use their hands . 
they use their hands to write applications that make the way of government . 
and these apps let let us hands use to hands to improve our communities . 
but these apps are , little digital memories that we are not just consumers , and we are not just consumers paying the paying who pay and and take contributions assets attainment . 
we are more than that . we are a citizens . 
and we 're not going to improve government , until we can make citizenship citizenship citizenship . 
so the question i 've all got here for all of you when , when it 's to the , important things we need to do together , all of , we we going to be a lot of votes , or are we going to be a lot of hands ? ? ? 
thank you . 
i usually usually going about to explain the people like amazing technologies are are at the rise , and i was , as i was here here my friends , i would tell you what i really really to look and also back and what 's going going , here and looking 's , on with with these amazing thing that we can keep swim here . front front of the way which we can barely compete pretty a way nervous . that very can barely fall 
i 'm going to start by showing showing you a single , boring slide to 
 . . . . you could , please slide point point the slide . 
this is a slide that i accidentally picked out my folder . 
it 's not about the the talk the details of this slide , rather rather a the overall shape of 
now the 's interesting here that this slide , like so of those other things which we 've been able recent to find in our field , is a logarithmic of false trajectory . . 
and this 's a novelty that that we need to use this double 's excellent on semi prolific curves in the technology . 
something very strange happens here . 
this is basically what crux i 'm going to talk about here 
so , you could turn the lights back up again . 
slightly more importantly that , because i 'm going to put something on on the paper here . 
now why are we draw graphs in martin semi accurate curves ? ? 
so reason for that is , i was draw it on a regular page , where we say , this is what years of so the timeline , a kind , and this is an arbitrary technology of what that which i want describe to a graph , is a to be a very of a kind reactor of a sort silly line . 
and look like this . 
and that don 't tell that much . 
but if something like this is , it changes qualitatively changing it changes qualitatively a qualitative . 
but that 's not so fast . 
now the question i i 'd to ask you is , you look at these exponential curves , you don 't see them going . 
it 's not possible that everything 's forever and and forever that as it . 
there are two options . 
either this 's going to be from this classic pitch here except it , something very new , up , it , or it 's going to happen this . 
that 's about percent 
now , i 'm an optimist , well i think i something like this , the way that 's going to happen . 
so that this is really what and , is what we 're in the process of now . a transition . 
we 're here on this line , where a way that 's 've been now to access this world from in a new kind of world of world . world . 
so the question i would to ask and i also want to make myself is how how is new world might going to be ? 
what 's the new state of the about the world ? 
because the transition seems to be very confusing , when you 're in . 
when i was a kid , there was the future somewhere around , and people often often talking about what would happen in . 
now we have a conference where people talk talking about the future , and they think that the future is lies . 
moving moving don 't go . than this sidewalk . do going . 
so in other words , the future has decreased every year since i am in this world . 
and i think the reason for this is that we 've already realized working . 
the transition is happening . we can feel it . 
and we know now now isn 't just to be and look a point in way or the future , because to look at the future , everything 's going to be so different , a a simple simply idiot sense of what we 're doing now is don 't make sense . 
i i 'd like to talk about what this might be , this transition in which way we 're at the moment . 
to make this , i of 'm going to talk about some other things that really have nothing to do with technology or computers . 
because i think that really really can , , we have to step a step back and look at the object on a longer recovery timescale 
and i would like to show at this on the sample timescale the planet on . 
i think the makes the in your valid sense of bringing it over a few billion steps 
so if you look at the way that these chemicals were organized , then this gives us a pretty good picture about how the are the question . 
some of those oil droplet droplet , a particular combination of chemicals that they them to bring chemicals chemicals from the healing and to move . 
they of them were so clustered . 
but oil droplet wasn not alive today , because each pile them four , only just a little bit of a dangerous , random biofuel . of 
and each time it was , it have sacrificed to more disparate amounts of 
so every droplet became a little differently different . 
and so , has living to keeping alive , and they in of its depth of high at 
so this is just a very simple chemical simple form , but it , when this is a trick made to of an endgame trick . 
and anyone ways that we don 't quite understand , these functions successes have the ability to communicate information . 
they 've learned to store the recipe from the cell as information , and in a specific chemical of what we call dna . 
and amazing thing about that this kind of information has time over . time of . billion years , which they was born , in ? 
in fact , the recipe for us , our genes , which is from genes , from exact same code , the same wheels . 
and that is , every being applied the the same letter and the same code . 
in 's what i 've is i 've taken this code made a normal set to which we use to words graph , a piece of paper paper , and i 've it a . 
so if somebody a wants a hundred million copies , i have enough business in in this room , and even everybody everybody around the world , and it 's here here . 
so what 's the next step ? 
but then , thing moment , very interesting , in which things things were changed different , and that 's when the cells started to communicate and exchange information came , each so that communities were cells were out . 
i don 't know if they knew , , but actually bacteria can can exchange their dna . 
that that 's also why warming durability and likelihood of the durability of antibiotics occur 
some bacteria have figured out how penicillin could stay away from and they 've had those information with other bacteria and and now we 've got all of bacteria that were a resistant because each other . because to of which is that to it other . of bacteria communicate . each other . 
so they 've either , or they went together under . and that means that if community community was successful , all individuals individuals of the community once once again and and of on evolution . 
and the next thing phase is about a billion years . 
in fact , we 're a a way such such community . 
we 've got many cells that are out on their own . 
your skin cells are adaptive using , cells cells , cells so on . 
now next step happened now going within that community . 
and they developed special structures , did did not but using information within the brain . 
and these are the neural structures . 
they started teaching train and in the community , special structures , which were responsible for learning , understanding information , and therein information . 
and this was the brain , and the nervous system of these communities . 
so gave them an evolutionary advantage . 
because at at that point , an individual , now acquired within the time of a individual of time species , rather of having this evolutionary period . 
so for organism , example , a learn how eat a certain fruit fruit it liked and sick with sick sick it sick , the last time he ate . . 
and happened after is that individual individual organisms found a way to communicate with other . 
it 's a quite amazing invention when you think about it . 
so we take something very complicated , turn it into sound , a sequence of sound , and produce something very complicated in the minds . others . 
so this is us now work as as a unified organism . 
and what we 've done done is we 've started mankind , we 've begun to have started to 
the invention of language for for example , was a little step in that direction . 
and it connects us all together to something that 's much bigger , and also tries to keep it faster than we 've been there . 
so today , evolution can happen over the period of time . 
the first steps in history that told you about took a billion years of make . 
the next steps , the the nervous system , taking the brain , took a hundred years to drink . 
and the the last steps years , and speech and and so , , taking less little over than a million years . . 
and these next steps , as well a , seem to take a few decades . 
the more it change , the faster it . 
and i think that 's what we 're seeing here this domain data . 
we see the process that feeds itself . 
i 'm in living computers and computers , and i know that i could using the mechanism to i could build computers , not using , without even using the in the science today . 
so lab activity is to begin objects with such high complexity that it 's impossible for me to design that kind the traditional sense . 
it 's billions of them . 
and it 's it part implemented . it we we don 't even really correctly . 
one of the ways that 's particularly interesting and what i 've been using very the last bit is , evolution itself . 
and we we 're putting a clean piece of the machine that 's done on at the front behind 
so give you example , in the most extreme cases , we can make a program that developed from random ways . 
now , i 'm going to ask you all this very smoothly by , i can choose all , investments to take the drugs of the postal keys , to i 'm going to choose them in .  
so in other words , i first define what i want . 
so let 's say i want to grab of numbers numbers , which would be a simple example of 've used for this . 
so , , , the can best relative to 
of course , the at random , by chance , very very small that so by excluded from so i think the option is make this . simple set . 
but one of them might be happy of lucky lucky two two numbers in the right coconut of money . 
now i 'm saying , computer , take the one that have now where the text in came have on to the next . 
so i 've now up with a new generation of programs that have been from both programs that were from programs closer to the protocols of are more different . 
tell , , this process .  
again do again . . 
and some are some mutations . 
and try this do it again with another generation . 
all those these generations are only several few milliseconds . 
and so , i can have an evolution thousand years over a of years into the computer , or in , decisions more , times . 
i get the get the rules numbers i get the get out numbers stuck . 
in fact , these programs are as much more efficient as any program i could have predicted by hand . 
and looking at these programs and i look 't look at these programs , i can 't tell them how to work . 
i tried to understand them . 
it 're very and curious programs . 
but they did the job . 
i know sure , make that they do the , because of come from a series of tens hundred effective , which has it job . 
because they kept them right a job , making lives , they it 
we know that a process process it 's less useful when it 's too complicated . 
so we 're going to start to move on on computers computer , for a process that is designer technology . very different from the classical engineering . 
it 's allowed us things things with a higher complexity than they would allow us normal way to produce manufacturing . 
and yet , don 't understand understand the possibilities yet 
we 're using using these programs to make the computer a faster so so we can do this process more , and faster . 
so it creates a feedback movement . 
it 's going up and and i think it 's why it 's so confusing . 
because all these new technologies are spreading from today . 
we can going to go back 
we 've come to a point that is analog to be , organisms have to be formed organisms . 
so we are the loss , and we can can 't make what the hell we make is is actually at one . 
but i really think something something else happen . us . 
and i think we 're are part of the creation of whatever comes next . 
my story starts in here in rajasthan , in rajasthan , about two years ago . 
we were talking about that had the the past that ancient enlightenment seasons gone century the past of . the indian volcanic .  
when we became indians back travel back , the time , we 'd gone to go into a car , have across the skies . 
now we 're it with airplanes . 
we came to conclude conclusion that magic and magic with be replaced with machine . 
that was really unhappy about 
i made me feel that i could lose the ability to restart the sunset , lose a a camera , without my . face . 
i found that technology should make possible magic and not kill . 
and was like we were listening to crying watch and and camera cameras over track 
they they kept us inspired in 
and so i went into the world of technology to see how i could use it instead a magic instead for rather than to kill . 
i started to books . 
when i saw the ipad , i saw of it as a device to cover storytelling on the world . 
it can be figured as we think it . . 
it can be where we are . 
it 's bring in and text together and animation , listen , sound . 
it storytelling has to taken more senses . 
but what are we do with this ? 
here , text fingers points your fingers on any light the light .  
and so is is says . . . i i write my name . 
and from my book , it character in the book comes 
the child in me is of 's really excited about this kind of opportunity . 
i 've talked a lot about magic . 
i don 't mean by to a magician and kites but i magic of childhood , the ideas that we all had as children . 
fireflies found a glass of glass , i always thought to be excited exciting . 
so here have to flip the ipad , and the underwater use . 
and the way we go through the rest of the book . 
another idea that was me as a child , there that a 's be a whole galaxy in a single muttering . . 
and so each page here , and little and every world is going a little bit up wing that pulling i the lift up the magic device in the device device . 
and this opens up a card . 
and card grows growing , and it 's serving down into the rest of the book . 
it also shows up to other locations as well . 
i 'm going in here . 
and we bring them back to in a contemporary story for children . 
one story that often changing with new business , the environmental crisis . . 
and ecological crisis , a big problem last years is that children in sitting their rooms , in their computers , without their computers . 
but now with mobile technology , we can take our children into the natural world with their technology . 
in an interview of the book , you 're a to a search . you 've to go out and humiliate with camera of natural other of natural book objects natural natural objects . 
somehow , the don 't do more . 
in a different chapters , you have to put a piece of tree up and ring scan tag it released they put . 
so you actually actually create a digital collection of pictures that you can then put online . 
a child in india says , today i saw seen a monkey .  
and creates a kind network of a digital collection of photographs that you 've recorded . 
there are a dazzling array of possibility of magic inspire the world and technology together . 
and is the you filling up with screen with leaves . 
you gotta to get , noise , the book , and away drag the rest of the book . 
we all move into a world where natural natural of technology the can move and emerge things in the and technology technology . move . 
we use the from sun . 
we bring our children and and closer to the natural world , the magic , fun the hope of our childhood with the simple medium with a medium . 
thank you . 
this is really an very honor for me . 
here at ted to see here at ted and and to the , that is stimulated giving me a lot of force . 
in the short time , i 's one a clear ted , a ted identity has 
you can say things here that are the world influence impact . 
and sometimes , something comes ted is it matters a meaning and power that would otherwise have . 
i say that because i think identity identity is very important . 
we 've seen some fantastic presentations . 
i think we have learned that the words of a teacher will significance meaning , but the words of a dedicated fashion is special meaningful love 
and so i want to talk about the power of identity . 
i didn not learn this in my work by the way . 
i 've this from my grandmother . 
i became in in a family , a traditional household for dominated by a matriarch class of a matriarch , and this was was my grandmother . 
she was a tough , strong wife , had a real . 
it was also the starting point of many differences in our family . 
her parents were born in in the ' s when she was a slaves . 
she was born to and experienced the experience of slavery in a very strong way . 
my grandmother was very , but she was also ill . 
when i met her as a young boy , she came to me and gave me a hug . 
and she kept pushed me down hard could 't breathe . then she . let me go . 
one or two hours later , when i came to visit , she came , me , he , , you feel more participating ?  
and as i said no , backed her . if i said yes , let me leave down . 
and something was something that somehow you wanted you , always trying to your life way 
the only problem with this was she had children . 
my mother was the youngest of her children . 
sometimes , when i was time with her time it was hard to get her attention . 
my my cousins were all all over . place . 
i remember , i have have been eight or nine , that i went up one morning and woke up to my cousins around . 
my grandmother sat at the end of the room , started staring at me . 
so thought that this a game first . . 
i looked at her and i said , but she saw very seriously . 
and that went how minutes minutes and and then stood up and she over to me . and she took me in the hand and said , come on , come and , you and and i have to talk .  
remember remember it it was yesterday . 
i 'll never forget that . 
i said , well , pledge know . i 'll  
and she sat down and she me . she said , i want you to know that 've seen you . me watch  
she said , i think you 're special .  
she said , i think you can do anything you want to do .  
i 'll never forget that . 
and she said , you must just me three three things promises  
i said , ok , grandma .  
she said , your mom is my baby and you have to promise to promise you will always take about you . make .  
i was harvesting my mother , so i said , yeah , i is what to be me  
i thought , well , grandma . i promise .  
and , said , last thing you 've to promise to you will never drink alcohol .  
well , i was nine years old , and i said , yeah , blah . i promise .  
i grew up on land , in the old , rural , i have a brother who is a than a year older older than a year . sister . 
and then he took a sip of he provided to sister one and she took up pet , and then she me one 
i said , no , no , no . i 'm sorry . just just want a i don 't want a beer .  
my brother said , well , let 's do this , but do it , whatever else we do . 
i had something , your sister had something story . it a beer .  
i said , i don 't . to power do you just do . .  
my brother would me staring at it . 
he said , what 's going with you ? well , what is it .  
and he looked me in the face and said said , oh no , you 're 't always joke you ever than the entertainment of grandmother ?  
i said , what are you talking about ?  
he said , he 's everyone she , great hope . she 're special .  
i was devastated . 
i 'm going to give you a confession confession . 
i should probably do that . 
this is perhaps being being . 
i 'm years old and i 'm no , i don not teenagers happy . have to drop of alcohol . 
i 'm saying saying that , i think it 's really . i say that because , identity . matter .  , it 'm . 
if we can make the right kind of identity , we can tell people people around us things they they don 't think believe . 
we can get things to do things that thought they could not . 
of course , my grandmother would say to their great be a little special . 
my grandfather was in in the of . jail . 
and she believed that these are the subjects that would have to care about 
i tried to say something about our mandate court . 
this country is different from the ago 
today , it . 
the united states has today the highest rate rate the world . 
in social poor , and black parts of the population are terms of despair , because because because of those changes . 
we have a criminal court that they them much better if they 're wealthy and guilty than poor and poor . 
but , we seem to be pleased content . 
politics politics of has given us , us that these problems are not our problems . 
we 've lost touch . 
i think that 's interesting . 
here and today this today , percent of the adult population went voting right right 
i do children . 
many of my clients are very young . 
we 've already run a lot of time . 
the only country in earth . 
the question of death death penalty is a interesting question . 
that is a very sensitive question . 
but you can also think about it we see and how we see identity . 
the other view is not did made the a , but have we deserve to to kill ? 
i think that 's what lot of interesting . 
death death penalty checks america is by mistakes . 
in nine people we 've , one that 've for innocent pressure the dumped , the row and that of death row 
an amazing error . one of nine . 
i think that 's a makes fascinating . 
we would never let someone fly an a airplane if if they nine planes , that a crash , , as a as a should , dramatic a crash . 
it 's not our problem . 
it 's not our burden . 
it 's not our fight . 
i 'm talking a lot about these questions . 
i 'm talking about race and the question of whether we we 're supposed order health . 
and it 's exciting because i bring out students bring bring greatest american . i talk about slavery . 
i 'm talking about terrorism , the time for the , to , beginning of force , by and then beginning of the war war . 
we don 't really know very much about it . 
but for the american public this country , it was a time of terror . 
or 's been bombs . 
it was afraid fear of terrorism that her their lives . 
these these people are coming to me and they , mr . chen , you talk , you 're , listen tell about you tell people that they 're going to stop saying that we have going to do it in the history time in our nation with with terrorism .  
they say , no , tell tell people we grew up with it .  
and then the terrorism , of course , were extremely famous , structured to and decades the senior is they apartheid be committed and virtues . 
and yet , in our country , there is a dynamic we don 't like to talk about our problems . 
we don 't like to talk about our story . 
and so we don 't really understand what our meaning that we did in the historical context . 
we bump each each the time . 
we create always creating new tensions and conflicts . 
it 's hard for talk about race , and i think it 's because we don 't have to be willing to approach the process of truth and reconciliation . 
in south africa , people people have , the people tragic not is , the willingness freedom and come and reconciliation . 
even after the genocide in rwanda , there were these willingness to but not in that country . 
i 've had some talks in germany to germany to he . 
it was fascinating , because among of the scientists stood up to my talk and and he said , you know , it 's so very tutor experience .  
he said in germany . there 's 't a death . . 
and of course , it can never be any in germany .  
it just on very quickly . then woman said with with our story , it 's impossible that we 're ever keep ourselves back to kill systemic human being 
i thought about it . 
as it would feel , live living in a world where the german state of the would actually in especially when so lot of jews were alive lot of jews . 
it would considered aliens . 
and yet there there 's this mental growth lining disconnection 
i think our identity is under risk . 
and when when we 're not dealing about this difficult , the positive wired are the positive and wonderful things as 
we love innovation . 
we love technology and creativity . 
we love entertainment . 
i seems to for unite both two unite . 
because ultimately 're talk about hope hope , more engagement , more commitment to being a a complex world . 
to me , time to go forward and talk talking about the poor , the most deprived , will never be at ted . 
but thinking in think , in a way , that is in our own life . 
we all have to believe up believing in that we can 't see . 
we do this . so rational we are , very intellectual . 
innovation , creativity , development is not only coming out of our minds . 
they come from ideas that are pushed by the conviction in our hearts . 
in , when we fought in eastern europe , we wanted all to get anything , but what we needed was most was that a prepared care , mistress the having be on places and and witness witness .  
and this perception shift is the essence of what i think is that the ted communities also to engage engaged in . of 
i want to warn you , this kind of identity of challenges a lot more about when did worried taking about it . 
it becomes deeply activated . . 
when a young lawyer , i enjoyed spent privilege to meeting pink parks , who when young thing city . 
so these women together they would a , talked were unbelievable collective . 
do you want to come and and sit and stop ?  
and i said , yeah , that well .  
she said , what what what are you going to do when you 're here ?  
i said , i 'll listen .  
and i went over and i to just . this . 
and day i was sitting there listening listening i listened to this woman , and after a few hours of park to she turned to me , said , well , you , you first thing is , what know , what the game is . the . 
what do trying try ? do ?  
i started with i did going with the conversation . 
i said , let 're going to try injustice proposed . be . 
you want to educate people who have innocent . 
we want to switch the psychology and workers and the . 
we want something against the death penalty . . 
we want to reduce the death rate . . 
she said , that 's going to be very , very tired .  
and so i think that the ted community should be worthy 
we need to find ways . tackling that challenges that of we have an suffering . 
because ultimately , our humanity depends on our humanity humanity . 
in my work , i learned learned very simple things . 
i 've learned a couple simple simple things . 
we 're all more than we worst , 've ever done . 
i think this 's true for anyone on the planet . 
if someone is lying , he 's not just a liar . 
if somebody assumes something that didn 't be heard , it 're not just a thief . 
even who kills someone , not 't just a murderer . 
and because this 's the , would like to be a basic human dignity that that is the law must 
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and with many of the world , the opposite of poverty is not rich in 
i don 't think that . 
i believe that in many places , the opposite of poverty is . be . 
and finally , i it 's as dramatic and so inspiring , so excited , and so , can not at at the end of our technology , not in the of the that 're , not of intellect and and our intellect and minds . 
ultimately , a society is not measured at the way they treat their rich and the and privileged , but it 's how to 're to poor , the moral strategy , the divide divide 
sometimes i lose equilibrium equilibrium . it story to lose . 
sometimes 'm too much . 
i 'm tired of being all 
and sometimes these kinds are hurtling up , thinking , , a very serious way . 
i represent those children who were sentenced at very hard times . 
i go to the high hand and visited a client , might were be years years old , and should year should be with in front of the dish . 
and i wonder , how could that happen ? 
how can a judge transform somebody into something that he is not ? 
the judge has looked at him as a , but i see a child . 
you should also want a that want . 
and because it was too late , and i couldn 't really figure , i started working work on one . 
i had a year old , poor boys as clients . 
there was a crazy line who that no wrong in the country just do that that 's only struggle struggle . 
i i woke up the next morning , and i didn 't know if i was actually to be written this crazy mornings just to be get him published . 
and also really dismay , i had not just write him , but sent sent to court dish . 
a a few months passed i over and i had forgotten forget all . 
but i decided decided , i god , i have to let in of and do this crazy thing . 
i got overwhelmed in the car , and i was felt overwhelmed . 
so i drove to court court . 
and i thought , well , that 's how to be so heavy , 
eventually , i 'd out my car , and i stairs went to the court . 
when he saw me , he came over toward me and and he said , who are you ?  
i said , i 'm a lawyer . he said , are you lawyer ? i said , yeah .  
he came to me , gave me a hug . 
he then he said it into the ear . 
he said , i 'm so proud of her .  
and i have to say , there was a power 
it was something very in me , identity , the ability of contribute each contribute something a community , a a perspective of hope . 
now , was into the courtroom . 
and as soon as the judge saw me . 
and said , mr . bono , did you try this crazy teacher  
i said , . and then we started to debate . 
and more all all started to in , because were angry . they kept annoyed . 
i i had these crazy things . 
police and all in and hung polo orphan training . 
in the dark , , the young the courtroom were angry , the guy , that we were talking about race , about poverty , on poverty , over all . 
from my home , i looked at the job and go . 
he went up . 
so minutes later , the judge had stop . pause . 
and during the break in they brought in they tape castle , that were actually upset hurdle of the janitors to was been into courtroom . 
and did over to high voltage , 
he said , jimmy , what do you do in the courtroom ?  
the stood on the older man . he looked the head , and he looked at me , and he said , i 've here to say to this young man , you don not losing to beat the eyes . don 't you you on .  
that we 're not really designed to cope stressed human by human rights and human . 
that our 're survive with to be connected with each individual . . 
we we have to bring our vision of technology and design , of entertainment and creativity , with humanity compassion , with common sense . of justice . 
and mostly , i 'd like to argue you with those this 're just just , simply saying saying , don lose the target of losing eyes don don giving it . head . 
you 've seen in this crowd , this collective , an apparent wish , and help you and to help something . 
what else can we do ? 
the , , well , there 's opportunities everywhere . 
here , , for instance , you be a billion dollars over the next five years on a year on a penalty . . billion billion dollars . 
and yet , there happens is by with a roger end . 
here 's the chance to do something . 
this is going to suggest that the adds suggest in more and more , . 
i think there are opportunities . . 
during the past three decades , the rate rate america has dropped declining . 
what would you say to someone who believes ? 
now , the answer of changes sweeney has not very different . 
it was the crusade crusade of drugs . 
and that 's why the dramatic death results are going to happen in . the bin . 
i think we have to do more to help people who are become crimes of a crimes , not less . 
i think that 's what we need to change . 
they , you actually actually brought a string out the string . 
they are an inspiring personality . 
thank you for ted at ted . thank you very 
narrator famine somalia , in somalia , narrator narrator plots narrator narrator 
narrator the religious standards , queen deaths . 
so , different video warfare . . 
crisis . death . catastrophe . 
oh my my god . 
so these are just a of the clips that i 've collected over the last six months , but also the been could be six days . . or the last six years . 
the media is that the media actually to show us arose issues , because our minds understand sense those very specific issues . 
and there 's also a very good reason for that . 
every second , our day , our senses a to more information than any brain can ever process . 
and because we 're less important important single on our own , the first stop station all the information is a part of our comfort called targeting amygdala zone . 
it 's and it 's the whole information in for predictions on looking of of risk in our environment . 
so if if we see the news , we prefer to look figure out what we 're looking for negative news . 
and the old adage when it 's bleeding , the demand is very . 
now with all our our digital devices , we seven days the week , hours per day , doing the negative news storage all wonder , it 's not quite great at we 're pessimistic . 
it 's not a miracle that everybody thinks it 's all the world doing doing to . 
but perhaps this 's not the case . 
perhaps that that 's reality . 
maybe the tremendous ramp that we 've developed engineered in the last century by made a series of forces , so that it 's make us to create a the next three decades , a modest of abundance . 
now , i 'm not saying we we don 't have a big face problem crisis , burning , water and energy energy we we we 
and we humans , we 're much better at competing , problems of the long term , but ultimately , to reaching . . . 
so 's see at what we 've come in the last century so so we can figure development . 
over the last hundred , average average rates has doubled than doubled to income income tax on , population wide population has trebled . 
child death has gone down by a tenth of 
so steve bomb showed us that we are currently living in a very peaceful time in in the very peaceful . . 
we live in a truly extraordinary time . 
and a lot of people forget this . 
and we 're going our expectations , the time . 
we fact , we have eliminated nothing nothing . 
remember that a lot of americans that live the than percent poverty line , the they have access to stream , water , water , televisions , , refrigerators and refrigerators and cars . 
that 's why the cellphone costs about five times the than is less than a a supercomputer from the s . 
now look at this curve . 
this is moore 's law of last the last hundred years . 
notice want you to notice two things about this trajectory . 
first , all , it 're it in good times , or , peace , recession , depression and tragic . 
this is the x ray of computers building build faster computers . 
they 're down for not large problem problem . 
but also , despite their busy walking on the left , she 's going up . 
so the growth of the self itself is accelerating . 
and on this curve , on the back of moore 's law , we find this extraordinary variety of technologies available all available to everyone . 
 cloud computing , something my what some call the number of encyclopedias for autodesk computation , using , and and , y , d printers that allow us personal production to be reduce our planet production , synthetic biology , general food , use , output , medicine , nano , nano materials , nano technology and artificial intelligence . 
how many of you have seen the victory by somebody supercomputer watson during seen risk ? risk ? 
i , was a big time . 
i 've to change the newspaper , looking look looked looking for the best headlines that i could find . 
 risk is not a easy game . 
it 's about understanding the nuances of 
four years ago , ray kurzweil did . and ted , and here started a new university , called singularity university .  
we bring our students to work these technologies to as to be as cute , to be to can be used to solve the great challenges of humanity . 
and every year , we ask the students to create the product and services that , a decade or life life , we impact of people from humans . 
think about how , group of students today 's influence the life of billion people . 
years was been silly about ago . 
now can refer now in the fact of companies that have this . 
and when i think about creating abundance , i i don 't live a luxury for luxury for every planet it is about empowering a live a a life of possibilities . 
it 's about creating water being of water . 
here 's an example . 
this is the story of freudian mimic , in the middle th century , 
he 's the guy on the left . 
american families got getting utensils in silver , , even made . 
aluminum was , most valuable metal on the planet , valuable as times its gold and platinum . 
and though aluminum , percent one , is doesn 't come as pure purely metal . 
but then the technology of the process developed developed production the , production so cheap we use using this to of underwater with using to concept our marine mentality . 
let let 's just open this analogy to the future . 
we think thinking about with the . . 
ladies and gentlemen , we live on a planet of , times more energy is than we consume every year . 
children percent , all will all the on earth . 
it 's not about the shortage of the problem is passionate , is keeping . 
and there 's good news . 
in this year , it did it for the first time , to reduce the cost of solar in india by percent of the gasoline plant , rupees rupees to rupees in rupees rupees . 
the cost of solar fell solar wind year was to . 
and if we have a energy , we will will water . . 
let 's talk about wars . 
remember , as have was voyager this , when it was the the , when it was back to earth , back to earth ? 
he took a famous picture . how did it ? ? 
we 're on a planet that 's percent covers fuzzy percent of 
yes , there are . percent , , saltwater , and and and we 're fighting , . percent of the water on the planet , but here 's also hope . 
and there are new technologies , not in or years , but now . 
it can produce a thousand liters of water a day of water from a of different ass water , latrine , all and all that for less than two a mile mile . 
the head of coke has just recently to launch a big test project with hundred hundred units in developing developing world . 
and if it comes well , and i 'm very hopeful , it will going to use applying forward this global to the entire population in 
and we 've also seen this in mobile phones 
and as you 're looking at your smartphone on google , you have more to knowledge and information than president president years the ago . 
they live in a world that has information and communications in all of abundance , as nobody would have have predicted . 
and the the the best part of what we 're been doing to health the . 
i did the joy month with the foundation , with is to five called x 's x ray .c . 
imagine this device in the middle of a developing country , there are no doctors , but still of the insurance and , percent of the staff care workers in 
when this device is sequenced the dna dna , which is not known known , it 's known the center for center center and prevents prevents a pandemic to pull it . 
but now , the greatest force that we lead us towards abundance catastrophe of of abundance . 
i call this the the world billion . 
the white lines are on people population . 
we just just passed the billion mark . 
and only by the way , the largest humidity zones runs is population is a better educational and food in over the world . 
we did 've had this number to two billion people together each another . 
from five internet users , we 're get two of minus . two billion internet users . 
three billion new minds that we 've never heard of before will will join the global communications . 
what do we people need ? 
what are you going to consume ? what are you going to make ? 
these people represent several trillion dollars that going into flow into the economy . 
how about the community , wherever oppressed , wherever they are , to give away voice to of make care of what other , to , for the very first time ? 
what will these three billion people bring ? 
what about working that we can 't even predict ? 
one of the things that i 've learned by the instructors x is is that small teams that are passionate by the experience on and effort in creating extraordinary things that could do things that could only the great companies and governments in the past . 
i want to close with a story that really has me . 
there 's a program that perhaps have about of you before 
it 's a game called foldit . 
it was developed at washington at inverness . 
and it 's a game where people can take sequence sequence of amino acids from study , like the protein is going to evolve . 
and to its behavior , can predict the structure and function . 
this was a problem for supercomputer . 
and this is what game that newspaper professors and and so on . 
and there are now hundreds of thousands of people playing online game online . 
and what showed that today 's human pattern recognition would fold fold than fold day 
ladies and gentlemen , what has vivid that deeply faith our future is that fact that we have more than individuals to confront the great challenges of face . 
we 've access to tools using exponential technology . 
we have the diy , . 
we 've the effectiveness of the innocent aid . 
and we have three billion minds where we can work on to meet the challenges , and to do what it need to do . 
we 're been some extraordinary extraordinary . 
thank you . 
and i think it it starts with a medical audience , i am . 
and perhaps i 've had a long enough in business as if can safely of it let me just with a little of my own false theory is to make it happen . 
but before i talk about you talk about my talk , let 's start with a little bit key 
hey , why not ? 
we 're near and going , we 're going to start out on around all all over again world cup . 
we all love baseball , right ? 
and is is full of great statistics . 
and there are hundreds of them . 
 minds neutral performers teams is going to and turning around around trying to use a of these great baseball . 
i 'm going to relate to a statistic from most 'm most of you have heard this . 
it 's the tilt density of the muscle . 
we 're talking about a bat . . 
that means that the player 's certain , 
three . 
you know what you th odd called a major league baseball ring ?  ? 
well , really , maybe a star . 
you know what 's call a th street 
this 's someone that responds safe in the way of mind way . 
and as ted as at last in of the last seven league baseball players who happened in a season of to when they were happened a times . 
let 's move back to my world of golden energy , which way , this , perhaps , a little bit more comfortable than i 've ever talking to you about it . 
it doesn 't work . a way way . right that ? 
but , you know what ? 
it 's much much on it 's a the rise . . lot . 
and she 's beating . 
and , that doesn 't work . 
but i 'm going to ask you a question . 
 , very good . 
but what we do is , embedded each each of you , including me , to in the world , the right scary claim 
never mind a mistake , no one ever talk about the details , how to do this . 
and this is the message i took in medical school . 
and at high school happened had , he question staff machine would really nail it , unfold for a drug . 
and so did like 
i plucked memorized everything inside . 
and all spent more and the time . i more knowledge . 
and i was , , i would summa laude . 
and i left this to the performance that i felt , i knew all , it , and everything , or , least i much to to aspire so to tempting to how 's so useful for to really it example system to i was supposed with from trial . 
at that point , was the art ugh ugh is , most word , , do a 
and the feedback to for my chief indicated . 
this is a state in the the heart rate is rather of forcing all at all a 's a part of the blood flow and blood blood and filling filling and 's and , and the river of it . 
and this was not a very substantial diagnosis . 
i handed her , made gave . treatment . 
i gave her her weeks . i gave her the printing from take the the heart . 
and over a year and a half , they started to feel better . 
i felt really well . 
and that 's where i made my first mistake i sent her home . 
actually fact , i made two mistakes . 
i sent home home with speaking with my chief , voice . 
maybe i did so quickly good reason . 
maybe i wouldn 't want to be anyone physician . help to 
perhaps i could to be so successful and do so capable of taking that i was going to be , and so 's how way of being able to make my patients to contact from them him . 
my second mistake was worse . 
i remember it yesterday . 
and i went back to work . 
the rest of day day , i had that feeling feeling in my stomach . 
but i 'm forward 
and at the end of the day , i grabbed my stuff , and i went to the car to go home as drive car when as i did something , did not i didn not follow . 
i went through the factory home from my way . 
the three words that remember ? 
 do the patients shooting were getting at their time ?  
asked the nurse 's video . 
so so she 's back , she said , register register register . register specific . 
so she was back . 
she was back and dying . 
i was shocked and apart reaching to lay apart . inner range . 
and after two , three days , they were never transformed to be awakening . 
she had suffered a not of of his . all was torture . 
her family got together . 
i then then , and and then some blackboards the things , and i jumped got the the the first time , the kind of our medical culture culture , i felt just alone not alone the , not the kind of shame that felt because can talk because . . 
that is the kind of personal shame loss shame . 
the unhealthy for 'm talking about is the ones who makes you protective active . 
it 's the one who says you not 's not what you did , but it 's bad . 
and that 's what i felt . 
but i would then say this question . 
why didn 't i ask the chief teachers ? why would i going to ? ? 
and then in my worst moments , how could i do such a dumb error ? 
why did i go to medical ? 
but but slowly kept turns it upset 
i started to feel better . 
and then on a day day , there was a hole in the clouds and the sun , , and i said maybe maybe might possibly i better off . 
and she did it . 
and i went working . 
and then it happened happened . 
it was just lot of the and i was in a hurry . 
he always showed up here . 
i looked in the back fixed , and it was a little pink . 
and i gave him an prescription of rice and him and sent sent him . 
and even as he left back of the door , he pointed at his throat . 
and she said , three words remember you ? ? 
 do the patients with what !  
and fortunately , he did not die . 
and 's some things , the hospital , especially if you think about it in 're working in a hospital , which has had on time of the patients per night . 
in both cases those cases , i never 't send them home home , and there failed still no persist in in their treatment . 
the other had tremendous diarrhea . 
in both cases these , , action , and they did been doing a good job . 
and i would be happy to tell you that my worst errors happened happen in the first five years , which is what i think is a complete nonsense my colleagues , but total nonsense . 
alone themselves , ridiculed become got support encouragement . 
here 's the problem if i can 't up mistakes and talk about her if i can talk , if quiet voice that tells me what really does 't happen to how how can i share it with my colleagues ? 
how do i teach you my mistakes in so make make they make the same ? 
if i had a space , , i have no idea about you think thinking about me . 
when did you hear that the time who last of a hearing business by about failure through manual cameraman ? 
oh , , you go to a cocktail party , and you are might hear about any other .d . but but you 're not going to talk somebody talk about your own errors . 
this 's the system in which we live . 
it 's a completely disconnected by adoption of 
it 's a system in which there are two essential places , the ones who make mistakes and the the ones who don not who don not , testing sleep without the energy , who the bad , with bad results and and the the good results . 
it 's almost circular ideological reaction as antibodies , cross attack you . 
and there 's the idea that if we make those , occur make going to make the of medicine that that we 're a safety system . 
but there are two problems in this . 
and what i learned is that failing , an profound . 
in the united states , the institute has analysis in analysis for medicine . 
sleep is ubiquitous . 
we can 't get rid of him . 
we have a cognitive mistake , have take a perfect match for a patient with chest pain . 
i don not taking to take the same course . 
i 'm not a robot i 'm things always the 
and my patients are not telling and to they 're not writing the same way . 
all of this is that . 
and then they can got your pupils dilate you 've been around in your head , you can down and you swallow , and you swallow to tell telling tell your stories . 
they want to share their stories . they want to share their stories . 
you want to be able to tell , look , don 't make the same mistakes i make .  
what you need is an local environment that you can drive . 
what they need is a new culture culture . 
and it starts with a doctor . 
the new doctor defined the is is decides be his humanity , is 's not pleased to mistakes , but canceled of this is takes sent to her so that she can be considered . 
they they share their experiences with others . 
they help to be thinking by when their mistakes . 
and she 's working in a medical culture that recognizes that people are filling the system with life , and when that 's what , people are make mistakes in time . 
my name is brian 's . 
i redefined the new doctor . 
i 'm a human . i make mistakes . 
i 'm sorry . but i 'm to get best of that it to cross others closing . 
i don 't know what they 're doing , , but i can live with 
let me leave with three of my own words i my own . 
i 'm going to talk about a little , little idea . 
and because you can explain this idea in a minute , i 'll tell you about three stories to use time . 
the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes . 
you know , was here . 
you might think that he is , but not 's not true . 
in actually made fish . 
he 's to describe one of them as very common . 
and was a grouper grouper . 
up to the year , he had in big lifespans style . 
now it 's on the red list . 
this story , we 've heard many of times from galapagos , and or from other parts , it 's not very very special . 
and yet we we 're still coming to the galapagos islands 
we still think they 're primal curious . 
they are still wearing of themselves as pristine , 
what happened here here ? 
because i 've it when i was going a lagoon in west africa 
i went to because i grew up in europe , and i on i wanted to work in africa . 
i thought i could integrate me . 
and i got a bad improvement , and i was convinced that i was really actually teaching a . 
it was my first improvement improvement . 
when i got back years later , the had gone down to half his size . 
they measured five centimeters of . 
they were ashes graded . 
it were still fish . 
people were happy happy happy 
and fish fish also had the good to be there . 
so , changed changed , and it has changed . 
now third little , telling my story story of my 's the time of southeast asia . 
we had no words for what we started there . 
now now know it was the reason up the ocean . 
 percent of our plaque lives , other animals that are connected to the bottom . 
the worst scenarios the fish dots , the there , the the peanuts cartoonist , they reef fish . 
and basically , the bottom for ocean violence up back down deck deck and 
these images are extraordinary because because the transition is moving really fast . 
within one year , one get a survey of elevation marine fishing , and then you fishing , fishing . 
this is a dead blood . 
they were not eaten , they threw them go because because they were dead . 
and then we started to living . 
she was 't a . 
then they wanted to kill them , because they could eat them well . 
in fact , this mountain of e is going to be accumulated over every time they 're in areas where they 're in never in to be been fish . 
it 's not documented . 
we 're not changing the world , but we don 't remember it . 
if if you chop it , you happens . 
over it time , it changes . it changes , people people , their course , their actions are quite of course . 
every generation is looking at the images that discussed beginning early start with in their lives life their lives , as a default and , is going brought most essential and it . 
the difference then gets a loss . 
but they don 't notice the previous losses . 
there can be sequence of order . 
and you the end you it end , you only want to keep the main . the . 
that 's what 's 're proposing now , it to 
we want to get things that have gone away things , that are not longer , them . 
you might think think that the problem was in to think about people who certainly certainly when where they were living , societies , animals , and they were just affected by a few generations of what , which they had done . 
because obviously , an animal that has been making a very of times , most comfortable , first , before it even even accessible before 
so you don 't lose any lot of animals . 
you 're always rare animals . 
and that 's why going it 's perceived a a huge loss . 
we 're focusing on the big areas of the big animals , the the ocean these we 're the big fish . 
they get less because we 're catching them . 
the question is why why do people accept ? 
now , because you don 't know it was different . 
of course , people will confirm it , confirm course , that it was really different . 
you will confirm , , because the evidence , as they are in an previous form , is aren not like to argue the evidence that they you the the . 
so we have the situation that people don 't know the past , even us we live in government to because they don 't have the past of the past . 
this shows the enormous role that a marine can play . 
because we marine sanctuaries in , past . 
what about the who cannot impossible able to do it because they have 't have access to the people in the midwest to 
here , i think , can fill in the and movie the fill movie with and simulations simulations . the can , 
this is the simulation behavior control . . 
long ago , it had a with there were bright years ago . 
and they follow of automatically and activity , and might remember the avatar . 
because it got something that had on in some certain . 
so my just recommendation up the only one i 'm going to do gets cameron so so he 's going to rotate an avatar next electronic hour . 
thank you . 
in the ' , in the tragically , you had to be in typewriter if typewriter that the government register register in the of government . 
the reason the government government could track where where the a text came from . 
and you first a first lesson foundation argument of , you could dowse the father of those magazine . 
and we couldn 't understand in the west how someone could do this , and how much that the expansion would be to freedom be . 
in our own countries we we would never do . . 
this is happening 's happening today . 
and that nobody doesn like no nobody 's 's running . 
and this was an example of what our own governments are using against us , the citizens that the citizens . 
and this is one of the three major sources of existing problems today today . 
so 's look back what look of 's really on in the world we can divide attacks attacks into categories . 
there 's criminals . sorts the place . 
and the themes of online criminals are very easy to understand . 
these people make money . 
they 're using online to a much money to make a lot of money . 
alfred war suppression is is 
stephen watts . 
lord risked is numerous in zero , unknown . 
and i 'm saying today that we are more likely to be likely the crime , from be the following from in the real world . 
and it 's very obvious that make that is going to get even worse . 
and in the future , of the crimes , going , they of the is going to come creative . 
they are passionate by something else about protest , or by by their audience . 
it tells how much was happens , undergoing to be in its if happens are going their own citizens . 
and was hacked and hacked and system was really 
and his answer was yes yes . 
now , how do people die in such a rigid kind ? 
he add selling electricity . 
but you you , if you were in a foreign weave . 
what about this happen happen with the arab and and things that happened in egypt ? 
and in this folder , one in paper germany was been launching a of the country to foreign a bunch of egyptian government programs , which they could very able to hold very lot , conversation with the country , . 
they had sold program sold for euros to the egyptian government . 
so western governments are branded to be a school adviser race a country product so that can get their own citizens . 
but western governments are help themselves . 
but today we we are far beyond . 
they tap their internet connection . 
so when we think thinking to think about stuff things , the obvious thing about people would be , , that sounds bad , but it doesn 't sound because because i 'm a good career . 
i don 't have to worry . 
i have 't have .  
and these argument makes 't make sense . 
privacy has to be full 
privacy is not at . 
it 's not a choice between privacy and security . 
it 's a decision of liberty and control . 
and as we , today , , our governments , , our governments are , to be free but , we the right to that , for forever . 
and we trust , we 're trust , to government , a us government , going we may have been years ? now ? 
and are the questions that have got to start thinking about the next years . 
they gave us aligned position to build stuff larger than we were , , buildings , a by upward to the other . 
a hundred years later , in , lego gene this . 
it 's automatically the automatically of rock . 
and within a few years , lego would move into every home . 
it 's estimated possible billion of stones , been produced or stones for stones person on the planet . 
they don 't have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful , beautiful bridges or beautiful buildings . 
lego if you did all for everybody . 
in the intervening years , in bell labs , the next frankenstein announced the next one , eventually the in . 
and the stone that allows us to build much deeper , loop sophisticated loop , loop loop on by , one rock for the other . 
i personally don 't accept that the emergence entity that one substantial reserved for reserved times experts for reserved experts , and so i decided to change that . 
so years ago , was at the media media lab , and i started to this idea of how to you power the power of engineers engineers in the hand of artists and designers . 
let let me show you how they work . 
you 're prefabricated radio music , white sound and your capacity . 
and the best part is that they connect with magnet together . 
you you can 't put them wrong . . 
the stones are color . 
green is britain , blue is the pink input purely orange is , . 
you can a blue dot on the green , , and you can make light . 
i 'm going to stop that . 
so to slow this up or slow down down , just pinch it on , that button , and it makes momentum slow down faster or slower down . 
and it was an incredible experience . 
the most beautiful thing about how they start to build the that they them in the world and not not in school . 
here 's an example of a project that they did a a motor printer , too computation . 
but wait , , this is really favorite project . 
and we want to make this material available to everyone . 
we want to encourage the creators , the inventor , the contributors , because the this world where which we live , this interactive world belongs belongs to us . 
so , they 're to come started and catch to invent . 
thank you . 
we 're all born . we bring children to the world . 
we have to deal on the inexorable and the boundaries of death , and so it should not not surprise that we all sing , and to artists and 
but what 's interesting is the unique shock of the play , the rhythms of the in every culture . 
and this is an idea that , you think about it , one can only fulfill your . 
and the crucial point for this is the extinctions of languages . 
when each of you was born in this room , they were spoken on earth in 
now , the united language of all family isn not just the whole of of the process seed a line of rules . 
a language is seen speech of the human mind . 
it 's a means with which the human will access to certain culture world the tangible world . 
and from these languages , today , as we 're in monterey , exactly half of our are no longer in the ear of children 's 
they 're not taught more than quadruple . that means if nothing 's being , they 're actually already dead . 
what could be be as as the silence , of the conference to to be one of the last people in speak speaking to your language who speak speaking unable allowed have the wisdom of the contagion communicating , pass things , or hope hope that hope hope of what ? 
and yet this extraordinary a , actually fact , this extraordinary destiny , earth somewhere about , weeks , for every the fact two weeks , every elderly person , a 's 's a older person to death of takes the past old a massive of choke of 
philip , .  
and then suddenly you would realize realize what it would be like if you didn 't speak your own language . 
now there are a of us who forget of forget that that if i say , say different ways of his , different , of our possibilities , different my collective 's 
you just listen and start start to . 
in , five missionaries missionaries were to get contact contact white electronics . 
you get a photo set of pictures from the air , which we would score as a friendly of it , forgetting forgetting that people people in came be point that there never seen anything additional the therapies in another . 
their signature could urine of a carbon that from a of distance the 're , of finding and what animal species was capable 
on the contrary , it 's a complex worldview . the way . 
it 's interesting . 
if i were to ask you , the big brother , big on , what would you say ? 
but what 's nice about this is this deep relationship between the living dead the dead . 
the living throws the spirit . 
we will dance to the temple , become god god .  
and because you 're obsessed with you get going to take your the mind . how can damage harm harm on a ? 
well the day , it 're governed by a ritual for me day , but the the priesthood , so extraordinary . 
it 's so wonderful . you need protect it .  
they call themselves older brothers and they say we are among younger brothers , responsible for the world of 
now this very the level of intuition is is very important . 
so , aboriginal of them are not sentimental , they become kidnapped them the hijack . 
now what does that mean ? 
it means that a small child out of the andean to believe that the mountain is the sacred which is in , spirit , or their it will a destiny , a certain person , become different different , a different relationship with that resource , this small child growing up from a tank , believing that a bag is a bag can a bag of rocks being can to that be a . 
whether it 's location control location of a gratuitous , , it 's full . 
the interesting thing is the metaphor which which is the relationship between the individual and the nature . 
now , when you start to at the idea that these different cultures can create realities realities , you can understand some of discoveries , what plants discovery here like instance , this plant properties here . 
it 's a photograph i took entered on the northwest amazon in the northwest jurassic 
this is ayahuasca , which some of you have have the most powerful bee cognitive the most powerful retiree of emotion . 
it 's 't become distortion of reality , but it of reality . 
we use this great euphemism , trying try and error mistakes , which turns out . be meaningless . 
but go you ask the indians , they tell , they know talking about us plant .  
so what does this mean ? 
and then they ask them what they went found their and tell say , i understand , you understand something of ' 
i mean , you don 't know anything ? all ? and i said , no .  
so it turns out that would every one of the members of the solution to a moon , singing to one whole , you in a collection of 
so , in fact is you remember , in the th century , not years , not not for wars or wars innovation , but rather than a era , we were in and which , and the destruction destruction of the and cultural responsibility , not committed from the earth either accepted so this problem is not the agents . change . 
and the problem is 't the technology itself . 
or when we go into the mountains from tibet where where i 'm performing a lot of research , you 're going to see the face of the political policies . 
and you can 't understand the suffering from a of the , you fail to see it in a level 
that meant he he as the chinese invasion immediately killed killed . 
his uncle , , with her sanctity , brought brought prisoners to nepal . 
his mother was locked up as a punishment for the fraud . as wealthy . 
and it it 's humbling to think that our species has probably around for perhaps past years . 
modern modern world world is we know it 's hardly years old . 
now , this shallow history tells me not that we have have answers to the challenges that face in the ensuing millennia . 
the canadian government is not not not very well with the inuit , during the first of , , as course establishment of establishment , of establishment of they us to move forced to invest in settlements . 
the grandfather kid this old man . . 
the family who the was afraid to his his life , took all the weapons and all the tools . 
now you have to know that the inuit has not the kind who a anxiety at the their , and used using them to their advantage . 
the granddaddy galvanized most didn 't fear up before the arctic , the storm . 
so you can 't do something like this . 
and this is a symbol of many symbol of the inuit of of the inuit in animals in the world . 
the canadian government administration in the national control , the full control effort a area that which it 's bigger than california and texas . . 
an example of how a nation , a state that can seek to seek its , state , and reach . people . 
and , , i think it it 's pretty obvious , at least for those of us who have to this distant beyond purposes of losing to realize that they 're not necessarily at . all . 
they are the people of countries . 
they represent the parts of the human imagination that happens into past the past times , and for each of us , the dreams of the children , the our dreams of our own children 's passions are the . 
what we 're trying to leave and do in national geographic is we believe that politicians don never get something done . 
 nations send our tv channel . 
our magazines are pronounced by millions of papers 
thank you . 
what i 'm going to show you first how quick as possible , i 'm going to show you the basic work of the new , which we can cover a a part model , a a ahead a four year four a , and it engineering part a biosphere , in it 's an site environment , either you can either go able to get with enormous many amounts of data . 
and it doesn 't matter how much information we look at how big these collections are or or size big the images are . 
it doesn 't matter , because the only thing that the output can a system that fixing is keeping number of pixels at your screen at now is it it has has a very flexible architecture . 
perhaps this is an artificial kind of being a . 
i wouldn not recommend it . 
every big is the the beginning of a story department . 
we also also done something at the corner of this particular guardian at 
we designed a wrong that very fake display with would much higher than regular regular display , and we added a content . . . 
if you want to see the functions of that car , you can see it here . 
or other models , or even special technical provide 
and does , that effort fragments these ideas to keeping it the of edge space on the screen . 
we hope that this no pop ups and others should to be more sorry about it 's 't need to . 
the of course , mapping engineering engineering is really of really really obvious applications for a technology like this . 
and i don 't really want to spend a lot of time out , except to we 're also going to contribute to this segment . 
but these are all the in the u .s . 
now 's kick give something with little bit . 
this is actually live on the internet . you can have it listen wow 
this is a project called energy around the behalf that which is really connecting two different technology together each other . 
so this is live on the internet . it 's driven by comprehensive . 
you can see this if we create these kinds of images where we can take pictures images and make this experience of . 
but the gravitational content of the images is here important in 
i don 't know if i have got time to show you other environments . 
there are what wetware , of 
i would love like be straight to very original role image , its and this is of by an early prototype piece these first paper we were been working on for the first summer to show you what i think is of , the actual 's really the the technology technology , 's referred , technology , and that 's not really so of the first to because you look about the website where you have seen on the website . 
we had to worry about the lawyers , and we had to worry this . 
so these are all images , , and they all everyone in spatial way in relation relate . 
and we can navigate very simple simple navigate . 
 . . know , i 've never believed , i 'll be at the . 
i 'm thankful grateful for the reception . 
and if i can , i 'll find some of the strange . 
many of you are occluded , their and everything on and 
there are a bunch of photographs here of photography there are . . 
this is actually a poster by notre dame , which is really recorded . 
we can shift from the poster to a physical eye of this environment context . 
the point is is that can do things with social environment . it 's now data data from all the collective memories of the content wisdom of content , the the earth earth , and going be connected to connected together be connected . each other . 
and of photos are shared and one other , and it 's something , something bigger than the sum of the parts . 
they 're getting a model made 's from all of the ground . 
and that is something that 's through to be through the , which people are using it , is it where to use its use for the user who are being higher and the user . the theory . 
thank you . 
 . i understand it right ? what idea is allowed them be connected within a specific of a given point within the next years , all of images that are being traded by somebody in the world , be connected together a other at 
yeah . it 's 't do anything other than that . 
if you will it also of you look the images . images slide . 
and it does this because of the content in the pictures . 
and this is really exciting when you think about the abundance of semantic information that many of these images . 
but what if the picture is tied to all your images ? 
blaise , this 's really incredible really incredible . congratulations . 
thank you very much . 
i 'm going to tell you some things from my book , the i hope , in harmony with the you 've heard . and i 'm going to try to make some few connections , if you have not had . . 
i 'd to start with what i call official dogma . 
official official language is what ? 
the reason for this is that freedom is good in itself , valuable sense an to a to a altruistic assumption for human human condition condition 
if people have freedom , then each is to do for themselves , to to maximize things collective activities that our public welfare and no has the choose for 
and way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice . 
the more people have choices , the more freedom , have , and the more freedom you have , the more troubled the have . 
this is , i think we deep in our water supply , that it would ever happen to sense of the purpose . the . 
and it 's also deeply ingrained in our lives . 
i 'm give you some couple examples of what makes us to do . progression . 
this is my supermarket . no big . 
so this is like the supermarket . 
and then you go to the consumer electronics business to a large system , cd , a , a cassette tape , opera , amplifier , and in this font of electronics shop , there are so many modern . 
we can rerun , million different parts of stereo equipment of the components that are offered offered in this business . 
you have to admit that this 's a selection big choice . 
in other areas , world of communication . 
there was a time when i was a boy boy , , you could have any phone like that you wanted to go after long as he came off talk any . 
they rented her telephone . they did 't mine it .  
and a consequence was that was the , the telephone was never broken . 
those days pass over . 
we now have an almost set choice of telephones , specifically in the world of the mobile phones . 
these are the mobile mobile phones . 
and if you haven going to see it up until now , you don 't know if you were in your of you can surely be 'll be soon . 
and what it does doing is bringing 's helping people to run into to work in the business and and ask that question . 
now you what know what the answer to this question is ? 
the answer is no .  
it 's not a to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too . 
in other aspects of life that are much significant as than as buy that , the same explosion makes the same explosion possible choice . 
health it 's no longer the case in the united states , you 're going to go to and the doctor says score tells you what to do . 
instead , they 're going to go to medical doctor and doctor and tell doctor says , we could do a , or we could do b . 
a has got these benefits and risks . 
b has got the of those benefits and risks what do you want to do ? 
and you say , doctor , what do you do ?  
the doctor says , has these benefits and risks and risks has and risks and 
what do you want to do ? 
and if you say , if you were , 'd be a doctor , what would you do ?  
the doctor says , but i 'm not .  
the result is we call it the a ' it sounds like a good thing , but in reality , a of the tricks is a to the the decision making someone who 's making a that the computer of for somebody who not somebody , more , and therefore , the best one is to the best decision isn being is to to make news patient motto motto for 
there 's a tremendous marketing for all who are medical for me and i , thinking you think about it , it sense of because we don 't buy it . 
why are it that drives we can 't buy ? stuff 
the answer is , you 're the doctor dog to call and the next tomorrow , asking for eight prescription of the prescription . 
something as profound as our identity , now a matter of choice about describe the slide . 
we don 't inherit identity , we invent . . 
and we often reinventing ourselves as lot as we want . . 
that means that day , if you wake up in the morning morning , you have to decide what you of person you want to be . 
in terms of marriage and family , there was a time in prolonged thinking that almost everybody was a and they got so to get so fast after they got really , and then just fast as they got , could 
the only long is was who , not do , and what what they did after . 
and , everything 's easy too to have . 
i teach students bright students , and i 'll teach them less less than i did earlier . 
and they 's not because they 're both smart , and they 're not very careful . 
it 's because they 're preoccupied with things , they ask wondering , should i be married , not ? should i going to get married ? 
should i marry married later ? should i have kids , or should i have a career ?  
they 're all fears . 
and you 're answer those questions properly no this means all all the tasks i can going to do to not give with class course , has got to grade up with me 
and in fact , you should be this . these are critical and the questions . 
we 're also on roles as i man as , with allows that allows for to start every minute of every day of work on the planet to raise your hotel agents 
i 'm 't tell you because i want to use it . 
so what it means means , have an incredible freedom we make with the about time and again , , back , should should not work or should . 
we can watch our fellow while football , and we have our mobile phone on our hip , and our blackberry , and our blackberry , , and our laptop are our lap . 
and even if they 're shut once down , every minute we have your child at we kill a child kid mount in in a soccer asking with , should we pick also do should i take this phone call ? 
should i get to this email ? should i write this letter ?  
everywhere we look out little stuff and little things , material things and lifestyle , life is a question of choice . 
and the world that which we lived . like 
i i 'm trying that there were some couple of choices , but not all i choice choice of choice . 
and we live in the world now is 
and the question is , are that good or , bad news ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know what 's good about this , so i 'm going to do what what 's bad about it . 
all these choice have two effects , two negative effects on humans . 
with so many options you can choose , people get very difficult to decide . 
i i 'm give you another test for this , a is an study in charity in guatemala pension . 
and then tomorrow , and then , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and course , never will tomorrow . 
by mapping taking back to , they will be to united by propose states per would have been to to this their contributions . 
paralysis is a consequence of many options . 
and i think it makes it sound like the world looks like this . 
you really want to make the decision really when everyone 's for , right ? 
so that 's the effect , and the other effect , is , paralysis of that even if we get past of the and a decision , we make less less content with the result of choosing , if we had a chance to get the less choices . 
and there are several reasons for this . 
the more opportunity there is , the more competitive the 's not tinier urgent that 's disappointing disappointing to the choice . . making 
so gilbert has made a big point by announcing explaining him how the evaluate things , depends on what we 're is on . 
well , if there look looking good to think of these alternatives , there 's just being systems of introducing perceived decisions that make them less less less content that they have . 
here 's an example . for those of you that are not new york , i apologize to 
but here 's what you should think thought . 
here 's some few of . 
very high fat real estate . 
pretty beach day . they good . you 've have for for yourself . 
what might it better ? the man is it 's in . 
i could park right front of my house .  
here 's another example . 
now , cartoon some some to 
he 's a saying now of living and perhaps doing things about . 
but more more that he does going going to do is who always decide to decide what don don not do other things . 
and these other things might have many lot of their properties to and it will be , what they 'll be to arguing . 
third grade effects report expectation of what i 'm . 
this struck me by i 'm going to exchange my jeans . 
i 'm wearing jeans , all the time . 
do you want to have color with holes 
my jaw was down below and after i turned , i would more liked the kind of , permanent that was the only way to i system way to do it .  
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour carrying all those bloody jeans and and that business and i 'm telling the best in jeans the best , the best jeans i had ever had . 
i had better . all those these choices made me better . 
but i felt bad . 
why ? i wrote a whole book book to try to explain it myself . 
the reason i me i felt worse about the with all these available options list , what causes something makes a good couple of jeans . 
i had very low expectations . i had no concrete expectations than it were in a way limited way . 
when they came to the damn , one that them would have been perfect perfect place of it . 
and what i was doing was , but it wasn 't perfect . 
and compared i to what i got to what i had , what what i was , disappointing was was was was so . . 
add add that from of opportunities to the lives of people carries inevitably have the expectations that will have about how well these options will be . 
and this leads to less satisfaction in well , results as the result are good . 
no one in the whole of marketing marketing don 't know . because if you would all of you don 't know what the action to do . 
the truth is more like this . 
the reason is was stuff to be much good was anything was than anything was worse than to make it possible for people to make a pleasant sense . 
in , in the world we live in , we have been very wealthy , very citizen , with perfection as the best you that you can ever expect is the most you 've it to be . 
they 're never being very pleasant . because their expectation , they expectations , are my . 
the secret to be is , everyone they all all come to be the secret to derive low purpose . . 
i couldn not have done it anymore . i did not have a split . 
but once , not , it 's always a bad thing to 
so a consequence the things off the the defeat of the a child off when child is just if there if you are in , and you 're going , and ask yourself , why who who know , who answer is clear the world is absolutely . what could you do ? 
when hundreds of different kinds of jeans available , and they 're out , and they is it , what who who who is responsible ? 
it 's also clear that the answer to the question is it 
they could have done better . 
with different kinds of jeans in jeans ties , there 's not sorry for it . 
and so , as people make decisions , and even though the results of good about , they feel frustrated of frustrated about being , they seem themselves . it . 
so for clinical depression is the medical 's time in the last generation . 
so let me just . 
this is the official , but that which that we 're all holding , , is 's not wrong it it 's not true . 
there 's no question about a little choice than better than a , one , but it doesn not going to follow much determined than a selection . 
there 's a magic of magic things . i don 't know what it is . 
i 'm pretty sure that we 've missed this long long time , on our 've had entertained our . 
now , when a policy , 've almost finished to say , as an ideal , is to think about thinking thing that 's going on enable what all all choice possible in the organ systems societies industrialized , the most material , . is the richness of wealth richness . 
there are many places places , and we 've heard about many lot of them whose problem is not the problem of be a choices . 
your problem is that you have little low . 
so the things that i 'm talking about are an odd problem of modern , the , , western societies . 
what i 'm telling you is that these expensive expensive expensive it 's not easy , not working them . 
they 're hurt . 
they 're really getting about this things 
if something that would enable people to make such society of and make such societies so much , it in would shift pushed into moving choice , not only would life lives lives of the people , but will will get our lives choice 
so , you read this cartoon , and , a very advanced person , says , ah ! what does this fish know ? 
impoverished , mind , easy have a little bit old a world , and that have the way of mind reading read it first . 
but the more i was think about it , the more i would to think , fish felt something . 
they increase the paralysis and and the bring the satisfaction . 
this is almost certainly profound to perfect security perhaps for the that for whatever . 
thank you very much . 
you know , i 've been talking about some of these projects before , about the human genome , what could might indicate , and that the discovery of new groups . genes genes . 
we 're actually starting from a new point we 're digitized to digitized and and now we 're trying to get from the digital code into a new laboratory of biology by building new life . building . 
we 've always tried to ask critical questions . 
what is life ? it 's something i i think has tried to understand that understand that in planes are 
we 've now to nearly years from and we we 've sequenced the sequence , the change from analog world change is analog world of digital world . the computer world . 
so , to ask , can we live or could we make in , from this digital universe ? this digital universe ? 
we did also able to relinquish it from about a hundred genes from the or or or , here . 
but if you look at this graph list that which is very simple , compared to our faith , it me , but if , if we all look this genes from one of the other ones we can do to , very unlikely to a lead to a living cell . 
so we decided that the only way to go this chromosome is actually to actually the turn down what enables us to ask into and components components and ask ask a of these fundamental questions . 
and so we started asking asking the can we take a chromosome ? 
and allowing makes the chemistry of , really large to painted what what has never been done before ? 
and if we can do that , can we start the chromosome ? 
our steps toward digitization of growth was exponential . 
our ability to write the genetic genetic code has been very slowly but but even , and our last point , now now be to a exponential curve . 
we started years ago . 
so turns out that dna is very , very difficult . 
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that can make small pieces of dna , even until long , but it 's an award process , so the longer you ever a piece of power , the more mistakes . 
so we had to design a new method of could build these bits pieces together and and the the things errors that we . . 
this was our first try at which , was at drawing interface ray , beginning the digital virus x . 
it 's a little virus killing kills the bacteria . 
we were making little bits , and we had successfully , correction we had a dna molecule from about letters letters . 
and then viral particles were then released from the , came back and killed , . 
i , i spoke to the oil industry , , and they said you would this model would . 
they laughed more than they do . 
so we think this this is a situation where the , actually operating own hardware can . can actually be in an contexts . 
design is key , and if you want to launch with the information in computers , this digital information really has to be that digital information . it 's all . be be . 
when we sequence the genome for first , the date was liberated in of a four fold , on times four megabits . inflated . 
part of the design of to create pieces , the letters are 're the and and the letters characters minds have to overlap with other letter to build much units of proportion saharan , they they also these . . 
we 've put unique elements in here . 
think about it , we have a two letter code centigrade , c , g and t . 
so we can use the genetic code to write our words , letters , thoughts . 
at had signed signed . 
some people were not that it wasn not a poetry . 
we 've them so just break them with a , there are enzymes that could put those and 
and we 've started to pieces , starting with the five to date records , seven to shine , together each of those devices making these with letters to put together together a system , manufacturing , to . . 
in each step , we 've made these pieces in the surplus to allow them sequenced , because we tried trying to create to create a very powerful process of what you 're going to see in a minute . 
we tried to get to the point of automation . 
here 's an example of it . there 's actually predator called shine cream was billions of millions of air of fact earth 's 
you can see in the upper field , that chromosome just drops apart . 
 then hours later , everything it each would could just like this . . 
we 've do thousands of organisms that 
in fact , nasa has shown that there are so much of it out there . 
these are photos above seconds seconds long time . 
this is publication publication that we recently 
this is over , letters code code . and it 's the largest molecule associated has 've ever defined based by structure is information ever attempted people . 
now how do we start a chromosome ? how do we activate it ? 
obviously , using 's very simple with a virus that 's much more complicated with bacteria to 
the new chromosome went into the cell . 
and actually think this this is the end , but we 've to get a further . 
so people who imagine evolution evolution as a gene at 's have changed a long from that biology . 
there 's the that are called restriction enzymes that actually digest dna . 
the chromosome the was not the cell , not supposed chromosomes we 've . 
it was , blue stick that we had inserted in . 
and it a very short time , it had all the characteristics of the species , and it and based on in a new species based on the new software that we 've given in the cell . 
all the proteins changed membranes changed which changed the shark , , was that was the straight line of observation we were reading . 
now i i dismiss that this is not the genesis of it 's a population rate say , . billion years evolution evolution . 
why should we do that ? 
i think it 's pretty obvious in terms of what we need . 
to put it into my brain , i was born in . 
today , there people on this planet are each year 's it been in , years , in four . it 's four . 
we have problems in foods food , fresh water safe water , medicine , fuel disposal billion people . 
it 's going to be a challenge for offer . 
we need over five billion tons of coal , plus billion oil of oil . which that 's . hundred million gallons a day . 
if as we think about biological processes , or any process of replace it , it will be a huge challenge . 
then then of of course , there have got all whole co from that material that that goes into the atmosphere . 
we 've now from from our discoveries around over the world , a database of about million genes , and i want to think that these are pillars design of the future . 
we 're going to hit primarily to the limits of biological reality , to to our imagination . 
we now the an a large robot that can build million of chromosomes a day . 
if you think about these sort different genes , or using processes to maximize processes use of the technology of efficiency , the hull vaccines , we can change that only a small team more than the last years of science . 
this is actually a video of actual software we we 're working on , where you 're actually designing sit in and design new species in airline keeps for on the computer . 
you know , we don 't know know what it 's going to look like , we know exactly what the genetic code looks like . 
we 're focusing focusing on the fourth generation . growth fourth generation . 
they 've corn other that released ethanol what is just a bad experiment . 
but , as we think , the only way we biology do a a grand effect with diet diet without , raises , that cost in food , or or the cost that we available to its availability is that when we see co coming and therefore work 're working to work on work cells , are . 
and and we are is have to technology to 
 but in our discovery , we have have different methods of divergent . . 
this is an organism we 've described . 
it lives in the deep sea , about a half and a half deep deep , in almost sound . . low . 
it converts taking co into methane use , using hydrogen , which hydrogen to . 
in a brief short period of time , we could be able to get one very of life 's life . 
you you know , we really really , targets get targets real of the entire petrochemical industry , all if you could 't do this at ted , where you ? a source the main energy to get the main . 
but at a , we 're working on that , the the same kinds to vaccines vaccines . vaccines . 
you 've it this year with the flu , we 're always on end back of and we have a little of , if it goes to the right vaccine . 
we 're a seven years member improve human , our the goal is to be survive long 've long long to survive long might perhaps be done good enough . thank you very 
so over the last ted conference , i gave an introduction to the lhc . 
and i promised to how explain to the machine works . 
so it it 's the far and for those of them who were then there then the time , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment that went on to the about miles . 
his job is to create the conditions that were less less than a billionth of a second after the universe , possibly ability of millions of times a second . 
it 's just breathtaking , ambition . 
this is the machine under geneva . 
we take mini mini images from each mini detectors into zillions . 
at this is work i 'm working , he calls to where is a in in the , , meters 
this is a spectacular picture of bridges construction construction so they you see see . . 
on the th of last last year , the machine kicked going for the first time . 
and this image was taken from atlas . 
it did great power in the control room . 
in other words , when we saw this picture on september th , we knew that the machine works working , what a a great rush . 
i don 't know that this was celebration life for of its , or this , as this someone visited to google side the front page . front 
it means that we have had a successful deal the . 
about a week later , there was a problem with the machine that had to here do this curved circuit here , this squad wires here 's these wires here . 
now , the engineers of these will look at them and say , no , no you they don 't . these are little wires .  
they can afford because when you put well down down at they they get so too because they . 
so negative , cooler the cooler gets dropped between stars , these wires can withstand the wires . 
this this is the result . 
now , all is wonderful wonderful when you think about the magnet about so tons and moving , . 
so we tapped tapped into the magnet magnet . 
and they had to remove what we did . 
we 're bringing to it . we 're getting going to get them . 
they 're all going on their way . 
by the , the lhc will be viable . 
we will turn on on , and we to first data in june or july , and we will take our journey to figure out what the building blocks of the universe are . 
now , of course , at a kind of time of we 're turning to think about the debate of science and about , of so it 's easy easy to reject it . 
thank you very 
i 'm a writer . 
books think to book of and it is more than that . 
it 's also my big , very love and love fascination . 
and i don 't expect that to ever change . 
but , psychologist though , a is my life has and happened to have happened me to reassess my work . this whole . 
now this this event , that i 've wrote a book called m , boom vocalize yes love , love , which was , , very , , say my previous for although previous the books from went out the world and they big event , operations , . 
for , do you worry get about me and say , don 't you fear that you will going to get this success all 
don 't you feel that you of you are continuing and never making a book of a world that who 's in interested in the world ?  
okay , that makes a really powerful thing 
people said , well don 't worry about you know never , you 't worry you succeed succeeded ? 
have you don 't fear that humiliation the of of kill you of a ? 
that , you know , 
the answer the the very to all of these questions is yes .  
yeah , i 'm afraid of all these kind of stuff . 
and i was always 
and i have even more afraid of the things that no one would get expected . 
like 's like algae and other scary things things things . 
but when if i 's about writing , i 've been going a long recently , and i wonder been wondering , ? 
is that rational ? 
is it unfortunate that someone should expect that he was afraid to be afraid to do the work that he feels to to do ? 
and what about that with the creative companies that terms of creating us , the same way , how is it not they 're the external state of which way that how do not do any ? 
so dad , for example , was , and chemists , i remember 't remember a in his s as a chemist , which he was to could be afraid to could be a . 
with with your chemist , john 's what 's going on with you ? 
and just 't happen to , you know ? 
but 've to have these kinds of calls , but not just writers , but the creators of all , but to have this kind of fat personal mentally . 
and even those who actually not actually become a poor job who program seemed highly be successful neglected out their talents . 
and that makes extraordinary to say that they can work through in life 's work . 
the question i would to ask today is this idea for you , collectively perfectly okay ? 
do mean , you know ? it you think looking at this , , because if you just at just a single inch , i don 't know comfortable this idea this idea . 
i love them caught them . 
and i find i 's dangerous , and i don 't want to watch them being like it gets going to adopt taken to the next century . 
i think it 's better if we encourage really passionate to live our big creative . . 
that is called i 'm fairly young . i 'm just about , years old . 
i say say the 's just straight , because we 's of the now , well friends the all have probably , biggest is that best success that 
oh , jesus , whatever . 
and this 's the kind of thought that people can get somebody to start at o 'clock in the morning , gin , and i and i don 't want to . 
i would rather be to do this work that i love . 
so the question is , how ? 
somehow somehow i i have to find a way to go it dent to actually , sense distance from myself and the absolute natural , what the reaction is going to be in the . 
and search gave me to the ancient greece and the old rome . 
please follow because join me , because the circle will close again . 
but in the greece and rome did not have people thought that comes from people , okay ? 
they believed creativity was kind kind of smart the , was from a distant , not source people the people coming would , for their unknown reasons . 
so is great . the didn 't really think a genius at a very smart , very smart very smart engineer a leader . 
this 's brilliant there 's is , because 's the distance of the hearing talked talking about the you psychological forces , forces that protect you from your work . 
and everybody knew it worked that way , right ? 
when if your work was brilliant , could 't have anything to do for you , , but anyone who knew had 've done this contest , that 's that 's 've ever you 
everybody knew your genius was was paralyzed a so 
so so the in thought time long time thinking about creativity . the west . 
it 's the beginning of rational sense and and and people started to believe that creativity came from completely the their own individual . 
for the first time in history , you hear this or or artists , as a genius of instead having a genius , the . 
i have to tell you , i think , that was a big mistake . 
it 's like asking someone to swallow the sun . 
the mating will , sets all up all the dire , and it creates all that lose expectations at success . 
i think this this action have prevented imposing to our artists for the last five . 
and if if that 's true , and i think , it 's the question .  
can we change it ? 
perhaps to have an into the 's relationship to the and the mystery of creative politics . 
maybe not . 
maybe we can try the earlier days of well experiment with a minute minute minute . 
i 'm probably not going taken you can take a trip across this trip . 
but the question i want to do is not why 
why not think about it ? 
and process that everyone knows knows has has 's ever trying to make , in in in other words , everyone doesn 't always to be properly here . 
she felt like she because it came , because it would bring earth underneath feet to the agricultural . 
she knew she was only to do one one of those moments , and that was race her words like the hell . 
and in the , they didn 't just fast , , she she ran and ran and but she didn done the house and i would roll the poem over and she would it . she said , she would carry over to land , and she said look for a poet . 
and then there 's these moments i and 'll never forget , that said that there were moments in them them away 
so she runs to to the house and and she comes down to the , and she grabs through her grabs grabs a pen , go pen , she was going to go by the point and she said , he was as a hand and put it . the hands hand and . hand . 
and with those opportunities , the poem physically on , intact on paper but but backwards from the last word to the first . . 
when i heard that , i thought , this is creepy what what my creative process is going on .  
it is not like my creative process at 'm not the channel . 
and i think many many of you have done that too . 
what does that thing to do with 
and how do we engage in relation to losing relationship no reason that not to keep in the opposite of of health ? 
but then he got more , stunned fulfilled me that was going me that he was going a possibility forward in los angeles , and it changed everything for him . 
he doesn 't have a piece of paper , he has 't have a pen , he doesn 't have a tape . 
so he starts , these trepidation , to , like 'm going to lose this thing and and i 'm going to be going interviewed and this song forever . 
i 'm not good enough , i 'm 't .  
but rather of getting into panic , he just stopped . 
he finished up doing all train of association and and he something completely new . 
he just looked up in heaven and said , sorry , can you see that 'm going to drive ?  
 i i like to see it when morning as i could just write a song down ? 
if you really want to be there , get back a dead moment , i can take care of you . 
and his long pigeon has after whole process has changed . 
not the work itself . the only was always as dark and it was . ever . 
but the process and the hard healing , needed picked up off , than than he had out of genius of of themselves , where he didn nothing get and and he he had come from come he 'd to do it . he it he had 't have to be a big , it . 
it could give a little , bizarre , bizarre collaboration , a kind of conversation between tom and outside , physical thing , which quite beautiful the . 
and when i heard this story , it was hurt a a little , i worked and and it 's me already . 
not just bad , but the worst of all times . 
but then i remembered talking to tom about tom heaven , open , trying i tried . 
so i took take my gaze from the manuscript , comment my my a blank corner of 
i 'm talking too you , you know , you , you and and i both both of you , if this book isn 't brilliant brilliant , it it 's not my fault till right ? 
because you see that i have all i have , invest have investing . i . . more than that . 
so if you want to to , you 've be there here and get got to be up deal 're going to run your the deal . 
ok . but if you don 't do that . . . . you know what , hell is with your . 
i 'm going to write writing , because that 's my job . 
and i want to go ahead the , which get here point of i was here for my part .  
those big solid , great , because the early were professional and and they were fantastic . 
but once and again , very low , something special happened , and one of the actors actually actually missing to . 
and i know that know what i mean , because i know you 've all seen in your life , seen an performance of doing . 
and all , did no longer just a more system system 
it was gotten from the , lit lit from lit down and lit all the divine through divine divine divine fire . 
when when something happened then , people knew what this was , they called it to . his name . 
they put the together and they to sing , allah , god , god , god , god . god .  
that 's god , you know ? 
and that 's been , because we need that . 
he merely just an grading with mortal surgeon , josh and maybe he 'll never get above to that very altitude 
and maybe someone 's 's never going to call god god name , god , if he turns to but what 's he going to do with the rest of his life ? 
it 's a . 
but perhaps not that it to be so full of times if they were 't believe in the well , the extent death of of their lives lives might coming to be . 
so when we start to think about it , this changes everything . 
what must say , i have going to say when if i 'm over it , it 't no fear . 
or not a a lot downhearted a fan about . . 
just get your job . 
and if , of your contribution contribution , for it can be . 
when your job is dancing , dance is 
and yet , dance computers dance spite will dance . 
i believe that and and i feel that we should teach . . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
it grows growing in the winter and and 
as as you see , it 's going on on the dark blue screen its this is the year ice in the winter of it in in the summer . 
in years , it 's going to be gone from here to 
we 're have methane with a in alaska flat region in alaska ocean of . 
whoa ! 
you 're , that 's going very subject , the is 's going to be we orbit you 
and one of is that this the tremendous greenland bath the north . 
but the volume of volume , far larger than ever . 
these rivers are a . 
on the other end of the planet , the antarctic , the largest bird ice on the planet . 
this is the smooth of sea level , like the . 
in the andean andes , the the the drinking water source for this city . 
they 've got expanding it of water system . 
but when you out , you will drop out on of your schedule drop 
and the predictions about what they 've read , , , 
four times as previous years as as in the previous lottery . 
if you look at this in the historical connection , you can see what it 's . 
in the last years years , we 've produced million for million co produced hour , tons of co every single . 
the biggest factor for global warming , besides deforestation deforestation , which is percent , is burning by fossil fuels . 
oil is a problem , and coal is the largest extreme problem . 
but let 're starting to see a change . 
here are the ones that were taken out in the last years , with some green alternatives , were being to 
authority it a a political speech in our country . our country . 
and that image reminded me of something . 
you 've seen it in the news . 
this happened at christmas . 
one of the commercials commercials the ads balloons was this christmas card . 
there 's a of scaffolding in the world , and it 's serving our economy . 
it 's too affordable and developing , and it have and there is bread . 
this is the source of the coal in west virginia . 
the most powerful sound is the head of immigrants . 
so , alliance with brazil started starting beginning two jobs in life . 
this is one , part of her . 
the fact is , coal is not dirty . 
we think it 's clean and it 's also also wonderful . 
so , don 't worry climate climate change . 
keep 's leave that quiet . 
fantastic ! this machine is pretty noisy . 
america is in a crisis , the economy , national security , the 
the red thread , all comes us is our dependence dependence way things materials very , which charcoal oil oil . 
one plan to get america back to work is , help help us helping warming global 
finally , a , the solution that is enough is to solve our problems . 
this is the last . . 
one of the simplest ways we our dependence on old fuels chaotic , sweep , to we world is suffocating to reduce our world . 
the future is here . wind , and a new energy system . a new energy system . 
new investment that 's were create for good jobs jobs . 
there 's an old african proverb that want to be alone yourself . 
if you want to get a go together .  
we need to move far , and that 's rapidly . 
thank you very much . 
the spatial understanding about very to how we understand a lot of our environment . 
more importantly , it 's physical , and you can just reach outward and your hands and guide . . 
i 'm going to start with some simple examples . 
and these interactive portraits are one words true . . 
so if i leave them side by side , you keep to be the interest . 
and they also feel their movements and their propensity . 
an one of thing of the interactions that we began to identify was that we could use everyday gestures on the data on like viewing to use things as dumping , how to do so with fluid . 
thank you very 
these are some kids coming on on a media lab , and i could get moving move them in and shot this video . 
they really loved it . 
one interesting the interesting things about applications is that people don 't have to give a lot of instructions of 
all you have to say is words words , you know exactly to do right 
here 's some people who actually this . 
here is our youngest beta tester and salons on the bottom right . 
so they him , they were just white . 
we wanted going to build home tool for . world of . 
this is felix . 
here he 'll the sun coming . 
the sun goes on the sun . 
now he 's carrying a a tractor trick . the scene . 
the orange tree . 
good work ! yeah . 
hello ! 
it 's a story with end with and he can resolution easy place to figure how 
bc . be . flying . 
each one has four variations variations you can choose which one would to use . 
and you can install these sound molecules 's can to the sequence , can then put at any way . 
there are effects that can change the live of live , like the filters and filter . 
you hook it up with a certain tone , and then you 'll then to it person . 
and critically even the umbrella of even critically picks apply to ability to the whole sequence . 
so let 's see . 
and add a bass . 
now i 'll going to do something on my wall . 
and i 'm just up filter with the drums that so i can actually run the live effect . 
i can accelerate the whole sequence up going the pace at one or the other , . 
and i 'll just hook the filter to you more than just . 
i can change the sequence as you 'm shopping . 
and by doing that , i don 't need to plan it in the end of the day , but i can still get it to while you go still changing to go it , and . 
thank you . much . 
so as you can see , my excitement is to developing new personal interfaces interface can better on to to way that minds and bodies with 
and today , i 've been time part of this new design , , some of the ways to 're been working on what we 're doing in our lab . 
thank you . 
i 'm forward to all conversation with i is talking . at . 
when i was years old , i was a to make a vagina recollection of the morning . 
my dad seemed stop to his little , , psychic by the broadcast 's day captains 
he called the taliban are gone .  
i didn 't know what that meant , but apparently made my dad very , very happy . 
 now you can go to a school , he said . 
i will never forget this morning . 
it real school . 
the taliban would the power in afghanistan when i was six , and they banned going go to school . 
so , i disguised to to five years as and i was accompanying my older sister , who i was not no arms sister who didn 't expect to come all himself own , too quiet 
so we could only get to class to go . 
we day , took another a different way , so that no one could figure figure correct we were going . 
we hid told to leave our hidden in a super way , as looked like we 're shopping . 
blood were taught in a house , about girls in a room room . 
in the winter , was very , but in the summer it was incredibly hot . 
we all knew that we spent our lives teachers our parents , and and 
we were never known about how how much they knew . 
are they going us ? 
did you know where we were ? 
we were scared , but we wanted to go to school . 
i had very fortunate in live into to a family as education education , important important for and daughters had been estimated . 
my grandfather was far ahead in of 
my my youthful , educated , educated educated educator . 
that 's them . 
two years ago , they retired to retired only just to a our house for a school for girls and women from neighborhood neighborhood . 
and my was my dad here to the first in his family to have ever had primary school . 
for him , however , no his children were become also , despite the children , despite the fall , despite the odds , 
he saw at it as a much larger risk , sending his children to school . 
that feel so good about losing , , but my dad said , then i am listening you you can lose everything in your life . 
your money can be stolen . you can get rid your house . 
but one thing will will you , to stay that the on , and even if we have to pay sacrificing blood funding for for your savings , we will do that . 
so do want to give up ?  
today i 'm years old . 
i grew up in a country that has been destroyed by the war of 
when i returned to afghanistan , my grandfather , who was brought away by his family , because he had it to the him daughters steam of to send his to school , one of the first to get . 
my family believe in me . 
i have great dreams , but my family has has bigger dreams for me . 
so i 'm global envoy for x , global citizens campaign for women . 
it 's lovely wonderful to see how high school writing high own to be numerous to be brave . you of you will be able odds . 
and to see how their parents and fathers and fathers , to , , as then as my parents , me , despite all fact , and are on charge of all business ages . 
so ahmed as ahmed . this is not his real name , and i can 't show his face , but is father of me dad is a gift of mine . 
just a month , his daughter and he was on the way to from her village to was village , and they were deaths by a bomb by a couple of about by by by away . 
when he came home , the phone rang the the and a voice and the front , if he told his to go with to school , they would try it . 
and he said , he , i kills now me now , but i 'm 't want to put the future of my daughter 's future because of your past , passion .  
in afghanistan of afghanistan , i 've something that often gets buried in the west , most of us are guilty the success , us , the father , standing father 's his life is recognizing worthy accomplishments and realize success is that their success . 
it is not to to be called our moms are not going role in our success . 
rather fact , they 're often the very good citizens , initially at to a promising future for and it their their daughters lives daughters , but in a wider like as in afghanistan , the support for the men is accountable necessary the 
under the taliban , only a hundred hundred young went to school because it was illegal . 
afghanistan seems to look looking at america , like that . 
the americans recognizes recognize , as insecure , are uncertain , of course . 
i worry afraid the changes don not for to take care , then the trigger for the u .s . troops changes everything . 
but when i 'm in afghanistan , when i look at the high school of my school , and your parents who are you , i see a very good and i good and of transition and 
afghanistan is a country of hope and argue that all of endless possibility , and remember that day day the girls who go going . 
just i have , you have great dreams . 
thank you . 
all i 'm was even for most living in my life had coined by seven years of work in africa as a young man . 
from to i 'm young , but 's 't , i did not zambia , kenya , kenya afghanistan , , helping algeria to somalia to algeria institutions of engineering developing world worked of african countries . 
i worked in italian education , i did a on single project we were to the legs cord . 
i was terrified . 
i , years ago thought that well , we 're good people and good work in africa . 
instead killed everything we did up 
of course , the permanent had absolute preserve not interested in this , so we were paying them for work , and sometimes they were also . 
we were astounded to think there such a spectacular valley there it was no agricultural valley . 
but instead instead than asking , they don not a hive , , they said , thank god , we we 're here .  
 in time time , to were hungry to save the bees in front of the  
we had this gorgeous tomato tomatoes in italy italy , they were the big in in the tall of zambia zambia . . 
 why did you not told this ? you never never asked us .  
i just thought , we were so walking instant in africa , but then i saw what the american did , what the french people , what the french did . i did , what they were doing , i was , proud of my project was . . 
you should see the nonsense , you should see the shit thing that which we had pound five man people down . up . 
the is published in . book . 
i 'm 't tell you what this money has created . 
just read your book . 
read read about an african , what we 've created . 
both of them wind from they were , as the latin names , which means father . 
but they have two different meanings . 
i 'm fantasy treat everyone other cultures culture as if they were my kids , i love you so . .  
this should be the first generation dimensional help . 
the first route of aid is respect . 
what you do your mouth . 
you never get a community of ideas , you put with the local people together . 
we don 't work from offices . 
we meet in cafes . we meet us pubs . 
we don 't have infrastructure . 
we form friendships and find out what the person wants . 
the most important thing is the . 
you can use someone an idea . 
if this person doesn 't like this , what do do ? 
the athletic growth for your growth in person is the most important . 
the value important for your own lives the most important of humanity . 
we help helping to find the knowledge , because no one can be successful . 
the the the the idea , people have the no idea , but it 's available to 
let me tell you a secret . 
entrepreneurs have have any of and they 'll never say publicly public terms they want to do with their money , what possibilities want the 
the the blind 's in this spot channel . 
people don 't know the community part , the community because they never meet in they never to be public meetings 
we 're working on one to do this , we 've to build social social infrastructure that exists 't exist . 
a needs a new profession that be to be created . 
this is a family population on a company company that 's in family that that lives with a family table , where in neighbor , and helps a neighbor , helps helping you find the tools to order to make your passion to make life life of the to 
i went to go and do on this and try to work out magical on my other of the work , where we say , to do , to to . . 
i was helping with , work together these , tuna , not selling sell a plant in a zealand for five two , but to raising hundred for for bucks 's , , and then the farmers came coming to me and , , you could help us .

local , passionate people . they have their in 
i would like to say that entrepreneurship are toxins of the the right way . 
we have to look at how we can feed seven billion people in a sustainable way , in , form them , and carry them with them 
the technologies for 't exist . 
who 's going to invent this green for ? the revolution ? what ? audience 
the government ? forget it ! 
it 's be entrepreneurs , and they will do be 
i read a very interesting history history in a particular magazine years ago . 
there was one group of experts who the invited were invited to talk the future of the city in new york in . 
they they , they came together and were , and shoulders would going in years with the city of new york , and the conclusion was that the city was new york wouldn 't be no there in years . 
why ? they looked at the curved line , and they said , if the population grows to this rate , they needed six million horses to carry up people , and it would be impossible to do with six six larvae horses . 
because they already went under that . 
 see at the dirty technology that hello sucking desalination life in new york . 
what happens ? years later , it 's been percent of the u .s . . . 
gifted , . ford . 
there 's a secret to work with entrepreneurs . 
and never 't get anywhere , you . talk 't talk them . 
the , you 've to offer all absolute absolute general , passionate and passionate service it . 
and you must to tell the the absolute truth about entrepreneurship . 
guess know ? 
we 've never met made a single person who can also something at , sell for can care of the money . 
that is not true kind of thing . 
this person was never born . 
there 's only one thing that 's been mean to mean of companies in the world , only one , has been created by just one person . 
never never and we . 
he wasn 't alone when he started . 
no one founded a company alone . no one . 
what can you ? can you make it ? 
okay , can you sell it ? can you pay for the money ?  
 oh , no , i don 't . you want me to find anyone for  
we activate entering communities . 
thank you . 
five years ago , i 've experienced how it must be , be , in wonderland . 
the penn of the parties government was asking me a partnership with software build software for enable communications american communications . 
i was frightened . 
real , fear . i of her big with with their big brains , their big books and their big books , and don 't think about were coworkers . 
just as i felt , i was doing to students , students , and i was astonished by the ideas they had and and wanted to discover that other might had to discover the . . 
i think to the this door need need needs to communication . 
we really excellent communication of our scientists and engineers to change the world . 
because our scientists and engineers , the ones who are the ones issues that like energy , environmental and health and and if and and we we don 't know about it , then 's not going to be troubled , i think it 's in our responsibility as a scientist , searching a conversation . 
but this great conversation doesn don not come by , our scientists and engineers don 't invite us in to invite us . . . 
so , and engineers , please , add up up . 
i want to show you some ways of approaches to how you can it , that we can see that science science and the technology that you 're engaged is really , and exciting exciting . 
the first question you must to be is , what it and well ? 
and let we us why is the scientific field so so to us . 
surely think sure if could play in perspective , but why don 't you just say space space much the drama for us to do ourselves ? 
now einstein said , things just just as things easy as impossible possible .  
you can 't tell us something about scientific historical , without worrying compromises deliberation . 
so of are in the at examples few examples of stories , analogies in in this way , you can blend of get us your attention . 
these these are just a ways to help us open up door and see this , the science and the science and technology technology in exists in mountains . 
because the engineers that taught taught taught me , share with the apparatus i want to bring engaged in the on , equation . i would blend to sum up the . a equation . 
so , scientists and engineers , if you 've solved that equation , by really commit me to . 
thank you . 
hi . so is my cell . 
a cell phone can change and and give a personal freedom . 
with a cell phone , you can film a crime in the developed of mankind who are in in this . 
with a cell phone , can tweet the and turn 'll a cry drop for egypt . 
all of this is possible with a cell phone . 
i 'm been years and live live in berlin . 
let 's go back to that town in 
and you can see how hundreds in hundreds hundreds , going to , change in the street and and .  
who , who 's the room does a cell phone like ? cell phone ? 
keep it up . 
keep your cell phones up , keep your up . 
keep it up . an android , a blackberry , wow . 
that 's a lot of almost everybody has a cell phone today . 
but today , i want to talk about my cell phone and talk how it changed my life . 
and i 'm going to talk about this . 
these are the verses text full information . 
raw data 
this policy policy the policy assistance code . access law . 
who calls calling , ? ? who receives a e to 
who 's receives send a text ? 
and once a mobile phone where you 're . 
all of that information is 's going for at least six months six months from their phone company or or their med designer 
and all around europe , people have up broke said , we don 't want to .  
they said , we don 't want this oil . 
we want each choice in the digital era , and we don 't want the telephone to the american to store together and we this information into 
there were lawyers , journalists , priests , who said all , we said , we don 't want to .  
and here you can see tens of thousands of people flocked around to the streets of berlin , and , freedom instead of fear .  
and i also wonder , this really work to work . 
can they really store all we of this information about us ? 
so time i use my cell phone ? 
and i asked her once and she asked her again and and she didn not get , i real obvious . blah . 
so i decided to first a machine a court against issue because you , because i wanted that have that information . 
and it was at it get to a comparison . 
i put my score back on what they were asking me the basics . 
so i got this ugly brown cover with a cd . 
and on the cd , . what . 
 . percent or information . 
i first first i saw it , and said , myself , good , it 's a giant file . don 't you know . 
but then i realized that after a while , that 's my life . 
this is six months of my life in this file . 
so i was a little bit skeptical , that ? 
because you see where i am sleeping with night , which is do . 
but then i said to i want to go into that information to the . 
i want to come out and see it . 
because i want to show people what is law is . 
this is a visualization case of six months of my life . 
you can zoom in such you you can negotiate through and negotiate . 
you can follow to reconstruct every step i 'll going . 
and of this stuff possible through all information . 
that makes a little afraid . 
but it 's not just about me . 
we 're all about . . 
it , all , it 's just , i call my wife , and she calls me up and we 're a few times . 
and then a friends and of call each and they call each other . 
and after a while , they call them and they call them up we have this huge game network . 
but you can see how people talk to each other , any time when depending they call each other to they go to bed . 
you can see all this . 
you can the central individuals , about , who are the leader of the group . 
if you have access to that information , you can see what the does . 
if you have access to that information , you can control society . 
this is a blueprint for disparate like china and iran . 
this is the perfect design , how to monitor a society because because you know who 's talking to who 's talking to talk to whom who email offers going to be able to do all of this information to that they have access to that 
and that information is saved for at least months , in europe up years . 
the case of the berlin 's , have perhaps been taken . 
and then , not the that , the death of the death prime . 
because today 's government agencies and companies want to activate so many information about how they can get online and offline and online . 
they want to potential to track our lives , and they want to put it all indefinitely time . 
but self backed they a life in the age , is not a contradiction . 
but you must to struggle for the self today . 
they have to struggle every day . 
so if you go home , you say your friends that your privacy century is is a st century worth of and this isn 't old . 
if you go home , just say about your own , just because you have government companies and state , you don the opportunity to store certain information , you it 's not 
and if you don 't believe me , ask ask your phone to phone to go to the information they 've you . . 
so , every time you use your cell phone , remember you remember to struggle that struggle that your self determination to struggle with 
thank you . 
i live in the at the south central . 
so the new of to change the name of , to so he would going to change in it in south bronx .a . , as though that something something that is a wrong wrong the city . . 
this is the angeles . 
people people are on central los local local central los grounds . 
i 'm 't know , rate i five times higher in i hotel of beverly 's about kilometers miles a half miles feet away . 
i couldn 't get that anymore . 
and i wondered how they felt if you didn no access to food , if you had to eat if time you go go out of the house , the negative effects on the food system that on your food food . 
and i really that that 's what it have to stop . 
dinner is the problem and food food is . solution . 
and also , i didn 't have a it , to i have apple apple to get an apple off of which which is not from any loads . 
so i planting planting a food forest in front of my house . 
it 's a piece of land called call targets modes . discovery .  . 
it 's feet feet . 
the story is the one it 's owned by 
but you have to practice like . 
so i think , cool cool . i can do what i want , because it 's my responsibility , and i have it 's to be in jail  
and i decided to keep it in . . 
and the garden is beautiful beautiful . 
but then somebody you complained . it . 
and i thought , well , right ? 
and i thought , great , that 's what i did talking .  
because this time it wouldn 't be to 
we kept the victory in the hands . 
so , why , not they do do that ? 
they is central parks . 
why the heck can 't not that stuff 
through growing plants , you can , seeds . 
with green beans worth dollars , you get fruit and vegetables worth of dollars . 
his own food grow crops is like as his own money energy print its 
you see , i have a legacy in central central . 
i grew up there . i grew up there my sons . 
see , i 'm an artist . 
my graffiti is my graffiti . i mean art . 
you would be surprised by the ground can largest , if you were it as a canvas . 
you can 't imagine how amazing a sunflower is , and how it touches people . 
so what happened ? 
i experienced experienced my experience how my own garden was been turned into education education system and the . my transformation . 
and change the community , you have to change the composition of the floor . 
we are the soil . 
they would be wondering how children were being to be influenced . 
and get get some strawberries . 
i remember when time , when this mother came , her daughter , , she was about night , and i were in in my backyard , and i were out and ridiculed were so that . 
i felt really bad at because they were there , i told to you , you , you don 't have to do that . 
the garden is not on the reason . the street .  
i performed my grandmother , when i saw people who were so close and hungry , and that 's made me to this , and people said to well , don 'm not to take care of people will that you will eat eating .  
and i said to no , no , i don 't worry fear fear that they mean up 
and this 's what road . 
now that 's the idea . 
i want you to take it , but at the same time , want you to take your mother back  
at time i i was a garden in this homeless , sydney street .a . in and 
these are the guys that helped me to picked have dog truck . 
it was just cool , they shared their stories about how it affected , , how they 'd been and in in their grandmother and their grandmother and and it was great to see how it changed , even if it was a moment . 
when i just , eating you , food , 
if you grow tomatoes , they eat tomatoes . 
i see young people who want to work , but they put watching them into this thing colored see colored kids standing right on the path path that they 're supposed coined to , and they conference that are 're going . . 
i think of gardening as an opportunity that we can train these children to take care of their communities to lead a living . 
and if we do that , who knows ? 
we of all , we could bring and george george here . 
but if we don 't change the composition 's positioning , we will never do that . 
so that is one of my plans . i want to do . . 
i want to share all entire toilet paper plants , where people can share food food block the same block . 
i want to take containers ship and turn it into a healthy cafe . 
so , don 't get me wrong . 
the the funny thing about sustainability is that you 've to hang them . 
so what i want going to do is do make this sexy . 
we have got to spin the painting of colliding action . action 
if you 're not a gardeners , you don not a . 
and , you time , you will a with so robot right ? 
and let the gun be your choice . 
when you want to meet with me , call 't call me at you want to go at the cushy with have a meeting session you want to talk about it , because you call clear shit , 
if you want to meet me , you 're to the shovel babies in my backyard , so make fuck shit out of 
peace . you . 
thank you . 
because it sounds so nice . 
something about saying i think . 
but the 's really important that words are at the center of politics , and all the know they they need to try to control the language . 
but that 's not true . it goes going back to a press of journalism tragedy . 
but to show you how the words and the are are , to i would to take them in the united states , where that time it 's reached the independence . 
you looked looking at the question of how you should call george washington , the state of state , 
you didn 't know . 
what 's it called the leader of a republican nation ? 
this was talked about an long time long debate congress . 
i mean , some people wanted to call him governor , and other other , his george washington , and just , protecting the , protecting the freedom of the united states of america america washington america america 's 
some people wanted king give call him king .  . 
they thought it was a test . 
it could have worked . 
but everyone was a bored because this was for weeks . 
the reason for the peak is just that , being the house in was the senate . 
king , , and may might bring another upward powers to his engaged . 
this is was president .  . 
we something like the assembly of a device . 
that 's why the senate refused to cancel him . 
they said , this 's ridiculous a embarrass you can 't call him president .  
who 's going to take serious seriously when if he had a sort brief name like , united of the united states of america ?  
and after just , the senate , the senate wasn . 
you can learn three three interesting things . 
one first and and i 's the best i i can 't figure out , the market 's actually ever , been name , the evil .  
barack obama , president obama , had just cover only all they just wait for the senate of the senate . 
the , you can learn that if a government is going , they you temporary factor years later , you 'll still years later . 
third , and that 's really important , that the most important point , is that the title of the united states of america doesn 't quite speak the much , it sounds today right ? 
and the story is the the cover best 
and so 's how the senate won on . 
they got a u title . 
but you you know , many nations have you have a president ? 
 . 
because they all want to sound like the guy with the nuclear warheads , etc . 
so the end won the the senate and and the 's lost lost because nobody has been , because nobody one feels somehow , if you , that you 're now , you 're the president of america united states of . is of america . 
and that 's the most important thing you can take away , and cut which stick . . 
the politicians politicians are trying to do is try to use the reality and actually change reality , but actually , the reality , they words reality words , , possibly change the tomorrow 
thank you . 
this was the first time i was in afghanistan . 
but that is the geography of itself . 
and what 's can be the jihad feel for the parliament and make a work with the slogan that the slogan , 'm jihad and i 'm having jihad .  
i want to look at how way direction of conflict in afghanistan , in have post conflict . 
but for all of those things , you can go to prison , you can be misunderstood . 
but i 'm doing it because i have to , the geography of the self demands to be 
that 's my burden . what 's your ? 
thank you . 
hi . my name is ms russell i i i work been working as a model . 
 years , exactly . 
fortunately , i have a to do on . 
if a few women were really startled when i first out , they don 't need to to say that to i 'll read read to twitter . 
i 'm also realizing that i 'm pretty privileged because because i can change in into which is very you think of me . 
and everyone 's not everybody everyone has had opportunity . 
and these blocks are very uncomfortable , so 's good that i didn 't want to wear them anyway . 
the hardest part is to pull the sweater over my head , because then you 're watch watch me at so as don nothing as as long as he is about my head . 
all right . 
why did i do this now 
that was embarrassing . 
now , it was not not as embarrassing as this image . 
image reputations are very , but the image is also on the slide . 
i just changed their view from seconds second totally seconds . 
and that this picture , i did did a friend . 
so means for me today to be honest today . 
and i 'm on this stage because i 'm a model . 
i 'm standing on this stage because i 'm a cute white woman , and in my business , call this a sexy girl . 
i 'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but i honest way . 
the first question is , how will you build a model ?  
i always say , , i discovered , but that means nothing . 
the ultimate best , as a became a model , is a asset position in the genetic lottery and a critical , and a you wonder wondering , you inheritance is . 
the next question that 's always given me is is i can i become a model if i grow a growing up .  
and at said not , first thing i i don 't know , that 's not in my responsibility .  
but the second answer that i really want to give this , why ? ? 
you know what ? you can become all . 
if you go say to no , let , cameron , cameron cameron a be a model , i 'll say , i 'll say my leader president .  
to say later that you 're to become a model , is , if you were to say you will going to win the more number later times lottery . 
it looks something like this . 
hopefully less strange than in in the middle . 
that is . . . . i don 't know what happened . 
if you 've finished school and you 've got a couple banned amp a a few jobs , you can 't say much more , unfortunately , if you say president 're to be president 's list but in , , you , model 're not strange , , you 're looking going to look funny . 
this is the very first photo i i 've done , and that 's the very first time i that i was not alive again a i didn 't even have my own . 
i know it is going to be pretty pretty who 's age real but i was a young girl . 
so i was just looking at a few of earlier , with my grandmother . 
my girlfriend had to accompany with me . 
this is me , the soccer team and in the magazine . 
and that 's me today . 
and i hope you 'll see these these pictures are not images of me . 
ok , next , , next are always asking me for nothing than nothing ?  
i grew up in cambridge one and one day i went to the store , had forgotten my money , and you had , i had a dress for free . 
as i was a , i was a friend with a terrible car , and she was you know , a red light night and then lastly stopped over the , it just a a sorry , sergeant , and we could do it . 
i got these bills because order way , and i get the same i look out the , and they people who are the way they look at these way they look , the , and they because of their personality as 
new lives only york only in new york , young , male and and latino , for which the won 't ask the  
what 'm going to say , how many times am i going to stopped ?  
and what i did for my talk about i found that percent of all year old in not like their bodies in the u .s . , and that number is increasing up percent percent if they 're been up . 
the last question to wonder is , what is it a model to be ?  
and we 're going to give an answer that might give this that impression . 
we say , it 's really great really great , travel , and it 's great to with creative , inspired people . work .  
all right 's true , but it 's just half of story , because what one what we say the the camera , as i 've never said before the the camera , i i feel unsure .  
and i feel unsure because every have to think of each life . day . 
as when i 've this series of i was , seemed really difficult to move in , an i felt like uncomfortable , i always standing here and and 's got here and saying , all got all the benefits from one pile one a pile , and it feels comes me feel well for it , it feel good that makes not happy .  
it was especially hard , a legacy of oppression because of gender and race , if i am one of the world world was . 
if if you take some little bit of a away from this talk , hopefully we 'll all recognize the power of the treatment in our lives of failures . the . 
thank you . 
i 've never forgotten the words of my grandmother , who 's come returned to live in exile , heart , his resistance resistance my resistance . 
but i 'm not going to do anything bit like a genocidal crime  
and there she was a a big revolution . 
young were young women , multiplied were in the first row , they wanted the end of the regime , would to be and the olympic of social air and and and social justice in 
they 've a strong sense of solidarity in by the far east , from to the west , to the south . 
after a time of five , six six months of war , almost dead war , we succeeded to remove our country , to spread our . ship bully . 
and what took out very difficult environment , which a was a lot hard environment , a lot system the opening that was the most dry institution , an of the and dominance . 
and the end , this , our 've taken over and , and successful 's succeeding . 
women did percent of the top in the first elections . 
but slowly but the devastating of the and the whole of the revolution revolution , because every immortality we surround up to new news of 
again , another morning , covered the covers of the atlantic covers of by the army . 
our society , shaped a , was a a recent mind language , concentrated and disconnected from the ideal and ideal principles , longitude liberty , became justice , which seem at committee at at the beginning . 
intolerance and and and and revenge became the icons of the revolution . 
i 'm not here today to inspire them with the success rate of our lives and the elections . . 
rather , i 'm here today to say that when , as a nation , the made the wrong choice and the wrong decisions . 
we 've begun through our priorities . 
because the elections do not occur frontiers peace and the in the . 
no , they doesn 't . 
so is it then ? 
our society needs qualitative , higher quality embodiment than they uses the cover , quantitative , of female female character 
we need to start by the name of compassion and grace grace of the . 
that 's the true one . 
after a verse from the quran , peace koran of peace is the word joy birthday ,  .  
and just like the cooling bear , which grows in it robot itself , is localizing completely holistic framework 's food . whole . 
so , my was told , , my wildlife , all of the things .  
so so 's why my my favorite lives were written front sense of being . front .  
may the of us will going to be the favor in the greenland of 
thank you . 
when i was little little kid , i thought my my country was the best ever of the world , and i grew into with nothing . 
and i was proud proud . 
and though i i would how the outside world is , i thought i would spend in all korea , up a comes everything . 
at the years , i first saw a public transit , , but i thought my my life was normal in north korea . 
my family was 't poor , and i i needed to suffer . . 
but in , my mother took a letter with me , sister from the sister , who a colleague . 
it this case , when you read this , our five family don not been to be in this world because we 've 't eaten a lot bit lunch for since the 
we lie going together the ground , and our bodies are so weak that we 're going to die soon .  
i was so shocked . 
i first to the first time that people had suffering suffering our country . 
shortly just was switching to leave i day stripping the of the train and and i saw something horrible that i i can 't delete more from my memory of 
but nobody helped them , they were all busy with their for themselves and their families . 
in the mid ' , there was great great famine in in north korea 
at the end , , end , more were a million north koreans of famine victim , and famine diversion and survive lot of other survived , grass survived still , they they were eating grass , beetles they were eating them . a population . 
i kept wondering myself they had lights there there , and we didn 't . 
this is a satellite by north atlantic and his neighbor at night at 
but a lot of deaths die . 
sometimes would see see bodies float around the start to 
i can 't say you much about how i i left north korea , but i can tell you that during the devastating years of famine after china . 
i was thought i was going to be apart from my family for a short time . 
i would never have thought it it takes take years to live , . 
in china , it was very difficult to live as a young girl without family family . 
and day my nightmare came came caught beating caught by the chinese police and scooped punched there the police police police . 
i was so to explode my heart . 
i thought that that was the end of my life , but i did get , i made my feelings and the answered proceeded . 
after the time they finished , a official said to a official ended the other , this was a hoax . 
and they let me go . it was a . 
these were very few girls . 
although even though they , were caught because of their pressures . 
it 's tragic that the action your north identity , having very , very hard to survive . 
even after they learned a new language and work , their world can be upended on a the moment . a . 
and after after years of hiding , i decided to go to south korea , and i started a new life again 
i 'm to down south , was bigger larger challenge than i thought i would have been . 
english was as so important in south korea that i had to start learning a speech . 
now , i notice the big difference between north and south korea . 
we 're all alike , but inside fact we we 've been divergent from around steadily to of the of 
i was went through identity identity crisis . 
where do i come from ? who am i ? 
suddenly of a sudden , there was no more land that my homeland would have been my homeland . 
and , though i had not the south korea , , i had 't have a plan . 
i prepared ready the bridge in the university of school university . 
just as i became progressing in i got sick new life called voice .  
they had to be so fast as they , so i started to escape their flight . 
north koreans must have any incredible run on their way . freedom . 
because my family did not speak chinese , i needed to lead them , miles more than , miles through china asia , and then to southeast asia . 
bus the bus bus was took a week , and we got it several times . 
once , as the bus was held , a chinese gorilla came in . 
he took the id from all the lives to and he started asking questions . 
because my family no 't have chinese , i thought they were arrested . 
he looked at me suspicious but luckily , believed me . 
after after adamantly had failed been consulting and and paid , my family was released , a month , but shortly afterwards , my family was released back in the capital of the capital was 
this was one of the hardest significant setbacks of life . 
i lost all of hope . 
and then the said the voice of a man , what 's going on ?  
i was totally very scary astonished , this . . 
i i thanked him all him all the heart and and he said , why would you help me ?  
 i won 't try you . he 
i realized that this was symbolic of temporary symbolic moment in my life . 
finally , after our long journey , my family and i visited back south korea , but the freedom to conclude to gain only one step . 
many koreans are arbitrarily separated from their families , and in soon as they 're to a lands country they don not low or they cash . 
we can also bridge the bridge between the in north korea , the outside world because because a of us are stay still with with to management and and we send them information and money to which to in north north to change the the 
i 'm sure you 'll see much lot more successful north koreans in the world , even at the stage stage . 
thank you . much . 
i just want to please these today . 
please 'm 't want you to tell . 
let 'd to introduce you to now brothers . . 
more , great handsome very handsome . 
in knows , what is love . 
he 's unconditional it he 's the they the mindlessly they 
he 's not greedy . he doesn 't look at skin skin color . 
he doesn 't care about religious differences and and imagine imagine he 's a told a lie . 
when he 's singing songs from our childhood words , he tries to buy , , remember , he remember me of a thing about the mind , and little as we know , mind and how wonderful the has to be . unknown . 
samuel 's . he 's big . he 's very , . 
don 't you sound incredibly incredibly incredible ? 
but people too people agree . 
and in fact , because you minds don 't fit the the production of normal normal , , they 're often going up keep and and wrong . 
but what encouraged my heart and my was that , although this was the case , although it wasn 't typical , even they were seen this , they only one one that they were extraordinary and extraordinary . 
now , for those of you who don 't so the kind application autism autism it autistic is is the is a complex way cancer can the social communication , learning can communicate affect physical skills . 
it makes a different , any individual different so system , , from this is as sam . 
and in in in the world , it and every minutes , considered in there , yet it 's one of the most rapidly growing up in life world alive than it 've known known cause cure . 
and i can 't remember the first time i met autistic autism , but i can 't remember it without any before it . 
i was just three years old , when my brother was born , and i was so excited that i had a new creature in my life . 
and after a few months , i realized he he was different . 
he screeched so much . 
he didn 't want to play the like the other population did , and actually he seemed to to at all . the . 
and as he became older , he became more visible and more visible . percent , 
extraordinary extraordinary . 
now , i can 't deny that there were some few great moments in my family , moments where i wish they were just to be . like me . 
but i go go back to the things that the things they they 've taught taught about individuality , of individuality and love , and i understand that these are that not ones that i would not be anti normality other . normality . 
indeed overlook perhaps , the beauty effect of the beauty , the we differences were , and the fact that we are different is not a not that one of us is wrong . 
it means means there there 's another different kind of stuff . . 
and if i could only say one the the things , and to give , it would be that you wouldn 't need to be normal . 
you 've to be extraordinary . 
because , not , differences gaps the , we have , , a gift , of one of us has a gift in and in all of all , the pursuit of fundamental , is ultimate is the ultimate for normality . 
the opportunity to scale , and and change is going to die the we try trying to be like somebody else . 
please tell 't tell me i 'm normal . 
thank you . 
but now , years later , we 're going to see a million time quickly , we the world not a a million or a billion , but one trillion one trillion one trillion . 
so , if you take your photons , you take this piece of content and you break it into this bottle , you do you break this photons into the bottle ? 
what does like in slow motion ? 
so , this whole thing . 
no , coke cola hasn 't fund that research . 
so , in this film , a really , , , so let me show show this , show you what 's going on . 
and there 's a of the light in outward from the outside outside , and you see that waves waves . 
many of the photons end up taking the bottle 's and they in different directions . 
meanwhile the same time , the waves on on and table and the position patch the table you see see that the end areas are up giving on a images . 
now , you 're taking a common economic and you the cover the the same channel , running the again slow down by the two billion times you know how long you 've to sit here to see the movie ? 
a day , week week ? no , a year . 
this would be a rather boring movie , a slow , , put in projectile movement in motion slow . 
and what about it look like this a little bit cartooning looking ? 
again can see the , these waves , the table , the wall , and the wall in the background . 
it 's like getting a pond in a pond . 
so , did my team built on this camera ? 
and we can take all of raw data , and do can do interesting interesting interesting stuff . 
so superman can fly . 
other heroes can be themselves come , but how about it be in a new kind of argument of a future opinion impressions 
the idea is that shine a light light on the door . 
and this isn not rocket fiction . we 've actually built it already 
and behind there 's a wall behind that wall , 's a and we 're going to put the lights on on 
after our paper published in nature of this , nature was called nature .com , and they called this animation . . . 
and of we know , of course , we to door , but we the tenderness we we 're in in , hidden body of objects , but we don 't know what point to recognize to . 
can we see it in d ? 
so this this is our reconstruction . 
but it 's happening here . 
if you look at these waves under the waves you see the the waves are the are moving away . 
the waves should move moving toward . us . 
what 's happening on here 
it turns out that we , , because we had almost flipped places three of effects , and einstein would seen this magnificent remarkable slide . 
the sequence in events in in the world , in the chronological order , so , reverse motion , by putting the relationship of space and time , we can correct these . . 
it 's time . thank you . 
there are many possibilities how our improve our lives . 
we don 't meet any neighbor on the street so many don 't get placed by we we 're going the same public spaces . 
in the last years , i 've tried to share more with my neighbors and use things like advertisements two stencils plus stencils and chalk . 
so the projects came arise coming out my questions , how much extra was my mean ? 
how do we borrow more things from disturbing each other ? 
how can we take our memories of abandoned buildings and understand the landscapes of landscape ? 
and how do we share our hope for small houses so our communities can our and dreams on our needs ? 
i live in new orleans , and i love new orleans . 
in this town some some of the most beautiful buildings in the world , but also is also the city city , the late american becoming is america . 
 lost lost somebody i loved . 
her name was joan acocella , and she was like a mother for me , her her death suddenly happened unexpectedly . 
i 've been thinking a lot about death , and i felt that enormous that my life , and it really me clarity to the things that i important to me now . 
but it 's hard to me to maintain this change at every day . 
it 's easy to lose and the day and forget of 's really important . 
i was 't sure what i would expect with the experiment , but the next day the the the the full day , and she kept kept growing . 
i want to sum some sentences with you that were written by the on the wall . 
 before i die before i want like to be you for some sort .  
 before i die , i want like to sing for millions of people .  
 before i die before i want a tree . .  
 before i die , i 'd to keep it in my arms .  
 before i die , i want to be somebody 's  
 before i die , i want to be myself .  
it 's about knowledge that you 're not alone . 
it 's about understanding our neighbors and in in a new and . 
i 've done this last year , and i 've gotten hundreds of the from who wanted to build a wall building their community , and so my colleagues made now made a kit and kit kit year , and now were 've been made in the world , worldwide , in fact world of , , , africa , australia other disappearing and and other walls . 
we 've shown how much power has our public spaces , if we have the opportunity to rise our voices to talk and share with with others . 
two most the most precious things we 've elicited are time and the to other people . 
in a world meaningful solution distraction , it 's more important than ever before , at things right that the right to think at and think think that life is too and unstable . 
we 're often restrained that we 're running from talking about death , or concern thinking about it , but i 've realized that the practices a preparation effort to the afterlife , and that is what most of us are 
the idea of death indicated us lives that life . 
our latest places best best thing that we think a community , and a community , and with more opportunities , our can vision , and sharing our narrative , hopes , the can not only help us to create better places , they can help us live better . 
thank you . 
thank you . 
so i 'm working on the . so , very problem for each of this , that the engineering , we , are like math . 
no knows what we actually doing doing . 
so today i i 'm going to try to explain to you what i do going to do . 
dance a dance is one of the most human activities . 
for then a a favorite a large scale of been found the open of skills , and the a basic basic component have a genetic component could could have a genetic genetic . 
over the years , you 've made a lot of progress in treatment of treatment . 
yet , are six million people who suffer with this illness , and they must to be with symptoms of are 've adore nightmare , restaurants filter , and other lives that are the this disease , causing we need to discover the objective , before it 's too late . 
you 've got to run it in the clinic . it 's very expensive , and that means that , these clinical trial of i never do this before . 
but what if we could do do this test ? home ? 
and that that would take action movement trip to the hospital . and would be be if the could do this test ? 
it wouldn 't take a for working ship . . 
it actually costs to by the way , to look at neurological extension . 
and as did they eventually lots , it . 
think , long a child needs , until they 's to speak . 
we see always seeing the same symptoms . 
how can these clinical trials to measure disease illnesses well , they 're not non invasively . the the neurologists side of the neurologists test . the neurologists . 
and as much . the is already there . 
you don 't have to build a new campaign . 
so you can be run by . 
they 're very quick , two , can 
they 're very cheap , and we know what that means . 
when something is extremely cheap , you can use use it in scale 
and amazing targets we can do this this now . 
we can reduce the care for patients . can too . 
so can get an data through observation discovery well can get to . 
we 've now been looking for the first disease search for the disease a disease than before too than before late . 
today we 're going to step into this , of direction , we 're going to the parkinson parkinson 's voice initiative . 
everybody who 's just or with no parkinson , can call cheap for affordable low to to leave seven few cents . i 'm served that we 're already comfortable six percent of our transportation in in our lives in 
thank you . 
if you tell samples , , we say , people , you can say who who is been , who who 's don not healthy ? who is healthy healthy 
what do you going to do with all these this samples ? 
some people may not be until the end . 
but we collect a lot database of information which a variety variety of different 's interesting , what 's things are important , because we 're in order to use this types to to markers identify what markers are not on parkinson 's markers 
right the moment , has of has ? accuracy ? 
it 's much better for 
that is what i call an improvement . 
so means that people can line people the telephone phone , the cell phone and and they 'll just the test , and with parkinson 's , pick their voice , that her doctor can target the progress of disease disease . 
exactly . . 
thank you . max , ladies and gentlemen and 
thank you , tom . 
i i live here i live in kenya on the southern national of the nairobi park . 
in the background , see cows from cows and the the , the cows in park . 
the predators , the lions follow follow them . and then you do this . 
they kill our livestock . 
this is one of our cows that was killed down in , and i woke him dead , it it was terribly destroyed it was our sole cop . it was our single . 
my tribe tribe , the in the masai tribe that we were bring with with our animals , ultimately of for as we animals , we really so animals . much . 
i 've had to hate lions . 
and kills do kill . 
here 's one in six prey that in nairobi . 
and i think there 's why in are in in nairobi national park , 
in my tribe , there boy between a years of responsible for the cows . so did it did . . 
i had to come a solution . 
my first idea was fire . lions are scared scared of fire . 
but then realized that this wouldn 't really help us but helping lions do help the to see more cows better . 
but i did 't give . i kept doing going 
i had a second idea . i tried to transport it with a scarecrow . 
i wanted to see of lions would standing by the side . 
but lions are very smart animals . 
you 're , the the scarecrow and and you go to to next time , and you come up you say , well thing doesn not moving , yeah , that 's still going to be here . 
and they grab killing and killing our food . 
lions fear light , and fear light . 
i had an idea . 
even was a more to the road kid one day in my room , and i then my my even even sharing to get my mother radio mom and the day she taught me almost to around do much , electronics . 
and i got on switch off switch the lights up and off . 
this is a little pear of the little choppers bulb a broken flashlight . 
and then i built it all together . 
you can that the major bulbs of the outside are , there , cables come by . 
and this is what it looks like for the when they come . 
the lights and all lions are all people that i was going in go in front barn , and i was in at time in the . 
thank you . 
i 've installed this in my home , often , and since we 've had no more lions of lions . 
and then our neighbors started coming 
one of them was this grandmother . 
they had lost many of her animals in lions , and she asked me if i could install her lights . 
and i said , yeah .  
my idea is now being used in kenya likewise likewise for other predators like the and as the other serve serve the the keep the lights from tourists as 
my new school worked worked to invested to being and education . 
i 've brought my friends back home , together together lights in where there are no lights and i 'm going people how use them . you do used . 
i was just a year from the savanna , who was tending his father , i i saw at planes , and i looked , one 'm going to sit in one day , sit in one .  
and here i am . . 
i used lions . but through my invention , i can save the cows in my father 's belly and the can share the side , on , side , with the lions , with discussions arguments . 
identity n . in my language , i means thank you . much . 
you don 't know exactly 's going to , that 's a story like listening . listening listening . 
so now 've this scholarship . . yes . 
you work on other enlightened inventions . 
what 's the next on list ? 
my next invention , now , i 'm working on an electric fence . an . 
yeah , i know fences , you 're been invented by , but i want to own . 
you 've tried it again , not true , i 've tried to do it , , but try and give trying back because i got , . . . 
we will be standing up an mentor of your remarkable , my your , my friend will will . 
thank you . thank you . 
since i was old enough to hold a camera in my hand , photography is but i 'm to share with you my , not with you no teddy part of them i not a single one of 
my story when when i was a talk in was in new york , and my wife was this picture on i took my first on her first birthday on we were at the corner of the corner of the box , th grade 
and then , a were , we , we new york and and to completely the same picture to playing same painting . 
now , you can see where the is going on . . . 
at that time , kicked started to ask tourists , to do a picture of us . do . . 
you know , it 's remarkable how universal the gesture of if you 're being carrying your camera . 
and we , we didn 't know how much these trips would change our lives . 
this journey has become very sacred . 
this was just taken by weeks to , and i had to explain what was the day that five five year years line can understand . 
they 're also an opportunity for us to be in a week in october , for period stop and change our time , , by , not only a a same , , not to be very similar very , . 
because even we do do the same image , it perspective changes by , while as it get to to halfway , i 'll be able to see the lives with their eyes , they deal with everything and how they see it 
and is very intense time we spend a little bit of that that and we 'd expecting odds time time . each long . 
and she told me about her feelings that which a five year period person that that felt at this was considering this . 
she said that remembers her her heart was out of breast , when when she first the first in years ago . 
and now look to new new york debate , because she 'd like to go to studying in new york . 
and it it struck me that the most important thing that all create is memories . 
and so i 'd like to share with you an idea of creating an active role in behavior conscious street your of 
i don 't know what it looks like , but apart from those images , i 'm not on a problem plan . 
i 've always the one who makes the picture . 
i want to urge you of come up with the image and hesitation , not asking someone wondering would you make make yourself picture of us ?  
thank you .
