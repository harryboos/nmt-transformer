when i was in my s , i saw my very first psychotherapy client .
i was a ph .d . student in clinical psychology at berkeley .
she was a year old woman named alex .
now when i heard this , i was so relieved .
and i got a twentysomething who wanted to talk about boys .
this i thought i could handle .
but i didn 't handle it .
 thirty 's the new , alex would say , and as far as i could tell , she was right .
work happened later , marriage happened later , kids happened later , even death happened later .
but before long , my supervisor pushed me to push alex about her love life .
i pushed back .
i said , sure , she 's dating down , she 's sleeping with a knucklehead , but it 's not like she 's going to marry the guy . 
and then my supervisor said , not yet , but she might marry the next one .
besides , the best time to work on alex 's marriage is before she has one . 
that 's what psychologists call an aha ! moment .
that was the moment i realized , is not the new .
that made alex 's s a developmental sweet spot , and we were sitting there blowing it .
we 're talking about percent of the population , or percent if you consider that no one 's getting through adulthood without going through their s first .
raise your hand if you 're in your s .
oh , yay ! y 'all 's awesome .
this is not my opinion . these are the facts .
that means that eight out of of the decisions and experiences and aha ! moments that make your life what it is will have happened by your mid s .
people who are over , don 't panic .
this crowd is going to be fine , i think .
we know that more than half of americans are married or are living with or dating their future partner by .
we know that personality changes more during your s than at any other time in life , and we know that female fertility peaks at age , and things get tricky after age .
so when we think about child development , we all know that the first five years are a critical period for language and attachment in the brain .
it 's a time when your ordinary , day to day life has an inordinate impact on who you will become .
but what we hear less about is that there 's such a thing as adult development , and our s are that critical period of adult development .
newspapers talk about the changing timetable of adulthood .
researchers call the s an extended adolescence .
it 's true .
as a culture , we have trivialized what is actually the defining decade of adulthood .
leonard bernstein said that to achieve great things , you need a plan and not quite enough time .
isn 't that true ?
so what do you think happens when you pat a twentysomething on the head and you say , you have extra years to start your life ?
nothing happens .
you have robbed that person of his urgency and ambition , and absolutely nothing happens .
or they say , everybody says as long as i get started on a career by the time i 'm , i 'll be fine . 
but then it starts to sound like this my s are almost over , and i have nothing to show for myself .
i had a better r sum the day after i graduated from college . 
and then it starts to sound like this dating in my s was like musical chairs .
everybody was running around and having fun , but then sometime around it was like the music turned off and everybody started sitting down .
i didn 't want to be the only one left standing up , so sometimes i think i married my husband because he was the closest chair to me at . 
do not do that .
okay , now that sounds a little flip , but make no mistake , the stakes are very high .
the post millennial midlife crisis isn 't buying a red sports car .
it 's realizing you can 't have that career you now want .
it 's realizing you can 't have that child you now want , or you can 't give your child a sibling .
here 's a story about how that can go .
it 's a story about a woman named emma .
at , emma came to my office because she was , in her words , having an identity crisis .
because it was cheaper , she lived with a boyfriend who displayed his temper more than his ambition .
and as hard as her s were , her early life had been even harder .
she often cried in our sessions , but then would collect herself by saying , you can 't pick your family , but you can pick your friends . 
she was nearly hysterical when she looked at me and said , who 's going to be there for me if i get in a car wreck ?
who 's going to take care of me if i have cancer ? 
now in that moment , it took everything i had not to say , i will . 
but what emma needed wasn 't some therapist who really , really cared .
emma needed a better life , and i knew this was her chance .
so over the next weeks and months , i told emma three things that every twentysomething , male or female , deserves to hear .
by get identity capital , i mean do something that adds value to who you are .
do something that 's an investment in who you might want to be next .
that new piece of capital , that new person to date almost always comes from outside the inner circle .
but half aren 't , and weak ties are how you get yourself into that group .
half of new jobs are never posted , so reaching out to your neighbor 's boss is how you get that un posted job .
it 's not cheating . it 's the science of how information spreads .
last but not least , emma believed that you can 't pick your family , but you can pick your friends .
now this was true for her growing up , but as a twentysomething , soon emma would pick her family when she partnered with someone and created a family of her own .
i told emma the time to start picking your family is now .
now you may be thinking that is actually a better time to settle down than , or even , and i agree with you .
but grabbing whoever you 're living with or sleeping with when everyone on facebook starts walking down the aisle is not progress .
the best time to work on your marriage is before you have one , and that means being as intentional with love as you are with work .
picking your family is about consciously choosing who and what you want rather than just making it work or killing time with whoever happens to be choosing you .
so what happened to emma ?
well , we went through that address book , and she found an old roommate 's cousin who worked at an art museum in another state .
that weak tie helped her get a job there .
now , five years later , she 's a special events planner for museums .
she 's married to a man she mindfully chose .
they are so easy to help .
likewise , at or or even , one good conversation , one good break , one good ted talk , can have an enormous effect across years and even generations to come .
so here 's an idea worth spreading to every twentysomething you know .
it 's as simple as what i learned to say to alex .
don 't be defined by what you didn 't know or didn 't do .
you 're deciding your life right now .
thank you .
but i wondered , what if there could be no boundary at all ?
i started to imagine what this would look like .
first , i created this tool which penetrates into the digital space , so when you press it hard on the screen , it transfers its physical body into pixels .
designers can materialize their ideas directly in d , and surgeons can practice on virtual organs underneath the screen .
so with this tool , this boundary has been broken .
but our two hands still remain outside the screen .
because windows and files have a position in the real space , selecting them is as easy as grabbing a book off your shelf .
then you can flip through this book while highlighting the lines , words on the virtual touch pad below each floating window .
architects can stretch or rotate the models with their two hands directly .
so in these examples , we are reaching into the digital world .
but how about reversing its role and having the digital information reach us instead ?
i 'm sure many of us have had the experience of buying and returning items online .
but now you don 't have to worry about it .
what would such a future look like ?
well , in this case , this spherical magnet acts like a d pixel in our space , which means that both computers and people can move this object to anywhere within this little d space .
and by digitally programming the object , we are liberating the object from constraints of time and space , which means that now , human motions can be recorded and played back and left permanently in the physical world .
and what 's more exciting than just turning what 's currently in the computer physical is to start imagining how programming the world will alter even our daily physical activities .
as you can see , the digital information will not just show us something but it will start directly acting upon us as a part of our physical surroundings without disconnecting ourselves from our world .
today , we started by talking about the boundary , but if we remove this boundary , the only boundary left is our imagination .
thank you .
when i was in the first grade , the government wanted to transfer me to a school for athletes , all expenses paid .
but my tiger mother said , no . 
my parents wanted me to become an engineer like them .
after surviving the cultural revolution , they firmly believed there 's only one sure way to happiness a safe and well paid job .
it is not important if i like the job or not .
but my dream was to become a chinese opera singer .
that is me playing my imaginary piano .
but no adults liked the idea .
no adults believed i was serious .
only my friends supported me , but they were kids , just as powerless as i was .
so at age , i knew i was too old to be trained .
my dream would never come true .
i was afraid that for the rest of my life some second class happiness would be the best i could hope for .
but that 's so unfair .
so i was determined to find another calling .
nobody around to teach me ? fine .
i turned to books .
books banned in china , of course .
 the good earth is about chinese peasant life .
that 's just not convenient for propaganda . got it .
the bible is interesting , but strange .
that 's a topic for a different day .
but the fifth commandment gave me an epiphany you shall honor your father and mother . 
 honor , i said . that 's so different , and better , than obey . 
it offers many insights .
for example , i found this map out of place at first because this is what chinese students grew up with .
it had never occurred to me , china doesn 't have to be at the center of the world .
a map actually carries somebody 's view .
comparative reading actually is nothing new .
it 's a standard practice in the academic world .
compare and contrast gives scholars a more complete understanding of a topic .
so i started reading books in pairs .
for the buddha , they are all psychological lust , fear and social duty interesting .
for example , it 's through translation that i realized happiness in chinese literally means fast joy . huh !
books have given me a magic portal to connect with people of the past and the present .
i know i shall never feel lonely or powerless again .
i have come to believe that coming true is not the only purpose of a dream .
its most important purpose is to get us in touch with where dreams come from , where passion comes from , where happiness comes from .
so because of books , i 'm here today , happy , living again with a purpose and a clarity , most of the time .
so may books be always with you .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you .
so when i was eight years old , a new girl came to join the class , and she was so impressive , as the new girl always seems to be .
and then i did it .
all of those a 's .
i gave everybody a row of d 's and i gave myself a row of a 's , just because i was there , you know , might as well .
i don 't understand where the idea came from .
i don 't understand why i felt so great doing it .
i felt great .
i don 't understand why i was never caught .
i mean , it should have been so blatantly obvious .
i was never caught .
but most of all , i am baffled by , why did it bother me so much that this little girl , this tiny little girl , was so good at spelling ?
jealousy baffles me .
it 's so mysterious , and it 's so pervasive .
we know babies suffer from jealousy .
we know that jealousy is the number one cause of spousal murder in the united states .
for that , we have to go to fiction , because the novel is the lab that has studied jealousy in every possible configuration .
in fact , i don 't know if it 's an exaggeration to say that if we didn 't have jealousy , would we even have literature ?
well no faithless helen , no odyssey . 
no shakespeare .
no jealousy , no proust . and now , i mean , i know it 's fashionable to say that proust has the answers to everything , but in the case of jealousy , he kind of does .
and we think about proust , we think about the sentimental bits , right ?
we think about a little boy trying to get to sleep .
we forget how harsh his vision was .
let 's look at why they go so well together , the novel and jealousy , jealousy and proust .
is it something as obvious as that jealousy , which boils down into person , desire , impediment , is such a solid narrative foundation ?
when we feel jealous , we tell ourselves a story .
we tell ourselves a story about other people 's lives , and these stories make us feel terrible because they 're designed to make us feel terrible .
as the teller of the tale and the audience , we know just what details to include , to dig that knife in . right ?
everything that she does that gives me pleasure could be giving somebody else pleasure , maybe right about now . 
but you don 't have to be that jealous to concede that it 's hard work . right ?
jealousy is exhausting .
it 's a hungry emotion . it must be fed .
and what does jealousy like ?
jealousy likes information .
jealousy likes details .
jealousy likes photos .
that 's why instagram is such a hit .
proust actually links the language of scholarship and jealousy .
he says , you know , look , i know you think this is repugnant , but it is no different from interpreting an ancient text or looking at a monument . 
he says , they are scientific investigations with real intellectual value . 
proust is trying to show us that jealousy feels intolerable and makes us look absurd , but it is , at its crux , a quest for knowledge , a quest for truth , painful truth , and actually , where proust is concerned , the more painful the truth , the better .
grief , humiliation , loss these were the avenues to wisdom for proust .
he says , a woman whom we need , who makes us suffer , elicits from us a gamut of feelings far more profound and vital than a man of genius who interests us . 
is he telling us to just go and find cruel women ?
no . i think he 's trying to say that jealousy reveals us to ourselves .
and does any other emotion crack us open in this particular way ?
does any other emotion reveal to us our aggression and our hideous ambition and our entitlement ?
does any other emotion teach us to look with such peculiar intensity ?
freud would write about this later .
one day , freud was visited by this very anxious young man who was consumed with the thought of his wife cheating on him .
and freud says , it 's something strange about this guy , because he 's not looking at what his wife is doing .
the poor creature is just under suspicion for no cause .
is she smiling too brightly here , or did she accidentally brush up against a man there ?
 freud says that the man is becoming the custodian of his wife 's unconscious .
the novel is very good on this point .
the novel is very good at describing how jealousy trains us to look with intensity but not accuracy .
and this is why , i think , jealousy doesn 't just provoke us to do violent things or illegal things .
now i 'm thinking of myself at eight , i concede , but i 'm also thinking of this story i heard on the news .
for a year . a year .
and she was trying to frame her ex boyfriend 's new girlfriend , and i have to confess when i heard this , i just reacted with admiration .
because , i mean , let 's be real .
this is something from a novel .
that 's one way to go .
i can 't give the world d 's , as much as i would really like to , some days .
i mean , we 're all good citizens of social media , aren 't we , where the currency is envy ?
does the novel show us a way out ? i 'm not sure .
so let 's do what characters always do when they 're not sure , when they are in possession of a mystery .
let 's go to b baker street and ask for sherlock holmes .
oh , it 's so familiar to me .
we 're proud of you . 
and he says that there 's not a man at scotland yard who wouldn 't want to shake sherlock holmes ' hand .
it 's one of the few times we see holmes moved in the mysteries , and i find it very moving , this little scene , but it 's also mysterious , right ?
it seems to treat jealousy as a problem of geometry , not emotion .
the next minute they 're on the same side .
could it be so simple though ?
what if jealousy really is a matter of geometry , just a matter of where we allow ourselves to stand in relation to another ?
we could align ourselves with it .
so while we wait for that to happen , let us remember that we have fiction for consolation .
we are in excellent company .
thank you .
it was a beautiful day .
the forest was sparkling .
we got to our campsite .
and i was astonished , i was very angry , and i was deeply confused .
that question stayed with me , and it simplified a little .
who cleans up after us ?
however you configure or wherever you place the us , who cleans up after us in istanbul ?
who cleans up after us in rio or in paris or in london ?
i wanted to get to know them as individuals .
i wanted to understand who takes the job .
what 's it like to wear the uniform and bear that burden ?
so i started a research project with them .
i rode in the trucks and walked the routes and interviewed people in offices and facilities all over the city , and i learned a lot , but i was still an outsider .
i needed to go deeper .
so i took the job as a sanitation worker .
i didn 't just ride in the trucks now . i drove the trucks .
and i operated the mechanical brooms and i plowed the snow .
it was a remarkable privilege and an amazing education .
everyone asks about the smell .
it 's there , but it 's not as prevalent as you think , and on days when it is really bad , you get used to it rather quickly .
the weight takes a long time to get used to .
i knew people who were several years on the job whose bodies were still adjusting to the burden of bearing on your body tons of trash every week .
then there 's the danger .
you 're in and out of traffic all day , and it 's zooming around you .
it just wants to get past you , so it 's often the motorist is not paying attention .
that 's really bad for the worker .
and then the garbage itself is full of hazards that often fly back out of the truck and do terrible harm .
it never stops coming .
it 's also like a form of respiration or circulation .
it must always be in motion .
and then there 's the stigma .
you put on the uniform , and you become invisible until someone is upset with you for whatever reason like you 've blocked traffic with your truck , or you 're taking a break too close to their home , or you 're drinking coffee in their diner , and they will come and scorn you , and tell you that they don 't want you anywhere near them .
they are the first guardians of public health .
diseases we 've had in check for decades and centuries burst forth again and start to harm us .
the economy needs them .
and then there 's what i call our average , necessary quotidian velocity .
by that i simply mean how fast we 're used to moving in the contemporary day and age .
we usually don 't care for , repair , clean , carry around our coffee cup , our shopping bag , our bottle of water .
we use them , we throw them out , we forget about them , because we know there 's a workforce on the other side that 's going to take it all away .
they 're on the streets every day , rhythmically .
they wear a uniform in many cities .
you know when to expect them .
and their work lets us do our work .
they are almost a form of reassurance .
and i tried to thank him for doing his work on that day of all days , but i started to cry .
and he looked at me , and he just nodded , and he said , we 're going to be okay .
we 're going to be okay . 
we are going to be okay .
but in our effort to reconfigure how we as a species exist on this planet , we must include and take account of all the costs , including the very real human cost of the labor .
municipal waste , what we think of when we talk about garbage , accounts for three percent of the nation 's waste stream .
it 's a remarkable statistic .
so in the flow of your days , in the flow of your lives , next time you see someone whose job is to clean up after you , take a moment to acknowledge them .
take a moment to say thank you .
hello , tedwomen , what 's up .
not good enough .
hello , tedwomen , what is up ?
look .
c .p . is not genetic .
it 's not a birth defect . you can 't catch it .
no one put a curse on my mother 's uterus , and i didn 't get it because my parents are first cousins , which they are .
it only happens from accidents , like what happened to me on my birth day .
come on a journey with me .
it 's christmas eve , you 're at the mall , you 're driving around in circles looking for parking , and what do you see ?
and you 're like , god , can 't i just be a little disabled ? 
also , i gotta tell you , i got problems , and palsy is just one .
if there was an oppression olympics , i would win the gold medal .
i 'm palestinian , muslim , i 'm female , i 'm disabled , and i live in new jersey .
if you don 't feel better about yourself , maybe you should .
i have always loved the fact that my hood and my affliction share the same initials .
i also love the fact that if i wanted to walk from my house to new york city , i could .
a lot of people with c .p . don 't walk , but my parents didn 't believe in can 't . 
my father 's mantra was , you can do it , yes you can can . 
so , if my three older sisters were mopping , i was mopping .
my father taught me how to walk when i was five years old by placing my heels on his feet and just walking .
another tactic that he used is he would dangle a dollar bill in front of me and have me chase it .
growing up , there were only six arabs in my town , and they were all my family .
now there are arabs in town , and they are still all my family .
i don 't think anyone even noticed we weren 't italian .
the people that i grew up with had no problem with my faith .
they did , however , seem very concerned that i would starve to death during ramadan .
i would explain to them that i have enough fat to live off of for three whole months , so fasting from sunrise to sunset is a piece of cake .
yeah , on broadway . it 's crazy .
my parents couldn 't afford physical therapy , so they sent me to dancing school .
i learned how to dance in heels , which means i can walk in heels .
and when my friends went and spent their summer vacations on the jersey shore , i did not .
i spent my summers in a war zone , because my parents were afraid that if we didn 't go back to palestine every single summer , we 'd grow up to be madonna .
i have to tell you , it 's very boring , but before i did yoga , i was a stand up comedian who can 't stand up .
and now i can stand on my head .
i went to college during affirmative action and got a sweet scholarship to asu , arizona state university , because i fit every single quota .
everybody loved me .
i did all the less than intelligent kids ' homework , i got a 's in all of my classes , a 's in all of their classes .
but i never got cast .
it 's a play about a girl with c .p .
i was a girl with c .p .
so i start shouting from the rooftops , i 'm finally going to get a part !
i have cerebral palsy !
free at last ! free at last !
thank god almighty , i 'm free at last ! 
i didn 't get the part .
i said , excuse me , if i can 't do the stunts , neither can the character . 
this was a part that i was literally born to play and they gave it , they gave it to a non palsy actress .
college was imitating life .
my dream was coming true .
they only hired perfect people .
but there were exceptions to the rule .
i never like to claim first , but i do know that they never heard that nasty little rumor that women aren 't funny , and they find us hysterical .
our goal was to change the negative image of arab americans in media , while also reminding casting directors that south asian and arab are not synonymous .
my big break came in .
i walked in looking like i was going to the prom , and they shuffle me into a studio and seat me on a spinning , rolling chair .
and she looked at me and she went , five , four , three , two . . . 
and we were live , right ?
so i had to grip onto the anchor 's desk so that i wouldn 't roll off the screen during the segment , and when the interview was over , i was livid .
i had finally gotten my chance and i blew it , and i knew i would never get invited back .
people say children are cruel , but i was never made fun of as a child or an adult .
suddenly , my disability on the world wide web is fair game .
 yo , is she retarded ? 
what does she suffer from ?
we should really pray for her . 
disability is as visual as race .
if a wheelchair user can 't play beyonc , then beyonc can 't play a wheelchair user .
the disabled are the largest yeah , clap for that , man . c 'mon .
the doctors said that i wouldn 't walk , but i am here in front of you .
however , if i grew up with social media , i don 't think i would be .
perhaps if there were more positive images , it would foster less hate on the internet .
or maybe not .
maybe it still takes a village to teach our children well .
it was the only time that my father ever saw me perform live , and i dedicate this talk to his memory .
so , we used to solve big problems .
on july st , , buzz aldrin climbed out of apollo 's lunar module and descended onto the sea of tranquility .
to get to the moon , nasa spent around billion dollars in today 's money , or four percent of the federal budget .
apollo employed around , people and demanded the collaboration of , companies , universities and government agencies .
people died , including the crew of apollo .
but before the apollo program ended , men flew to the moon .
twelve walked on its surface , of whom aldrin , following the death of armstrong last year , is now the most senior .
so why did they go ?
they didn 't bring much back pounds of old rocks , and something all later emphasized a new sense of the smallness and the fragility of our common home .
why did they go ? the cynical answer is they went because president kennedy wanted to show the soviets that his nation had the better rockets .
but kennedy 's own words at rice university in provide a better clue .
to contemporaries , apollo wasn 't only a victory of west over east in the cold war .
at the time , the strongest emotion was of wonder at the transcendent powers of technology .
they went because it was a big thing to do .
landing on the moon occurred in the context of a long series of technological triumphs .
the first half of the th century produced the assembly line and the airplane , penicillin and a vaccine for tuberculosis .
in the middle years of the century , polio was eradicated and smallpox eliminated .
for most of human history , we could go no faster than a horse or a boat with a sail , but in , the crew of apollo flew at , miles an hour .
since , no human beings have been back to the moon .
i remember watching the liftoff of apollo .
you hear it all the time .
we 've heard it over the last two days here at ted .
there 's nothing wrong with most of these things .
they 've expanded and enriched our lives .
but they don 't solve humanity 's big problems .
what happened ?
but i don 't think that explanation is good enough .
it mostly explains what 's wrong with silicon valley .
no , the reasons we can 't solve big problems are more complicated and more profound .
sometimes we choose not to solve big problems .
we could go to mars if we want .
nasa even has the outline of a plan .
but going to mars would follow a political decision with popular appeal , and that will never happen .
we won 't go to mars , because everyone thinks there are more important things to do here on earth .
sometimes , we can 't solve big problems because our political systems fail .
today , less than two percent of the world 's energy consumption derives from advanced , renewable sources such as solar , wind and biofuels , less than two percent , and the reason is purely economic .
coal and natural gas are cheaper than solar and wind , and petroleum is cheaper than biofuels .
but there 's no hope in the present political climate that we will see u .s . energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus .
sometimes , big problems that had seemed technological turn out not to be so .
famines were long understood to be caused by failures in food supply .
technology can improve things like crop yields or systems for storing and transporting food , but there will be famines so long as there are bad governments .
finally , big problems sometimes elude solution because we don 't really understand the problem .
hard problems are hard .
it 's not true that we can 't solve big problems through technology .
we can , we must , but these four elements must all be present political leaders and the public must care to solve a problem institutions must support its solution it must really be a technological problem and we must understand it .
it is not .
most of all , going to the moon turned out to be easy .
it was just three days away .
we are left alone with our day , and the solutions of the future will be harder won .
god knows , we don 't lack for the challenges .
thank you very much .
i 'd like to invite you to close your eyes .
imagine yourself standing outside the front door of your home .
i 'd like you to notice the color of the door , the material that it 's made out of .
i need you to actually see this .
and they crash straight into the front door of your home .
the light is shining down on cookie monster .
cookie monster is waving at you from his perch on top of a tan horse .
it 's a talking horse .
you can practically feel his blue fur tickling your nose .
walk past him . walk past him into your living room .
in your living room , in full imaginative broadband , picture britney spears .
and then follow me into your kitchen .
okay . open your eyes .
i want to tell you about a very bizarre contest that is held every spring in new york city .
they were memorizing entire poems in just a few minutes .
i was like , this is unbelievable .
these people must be freaks of nature .
and i started talking to a few of the competitors .
in fact , i have just an average memory .
and i was like , whoa . how come i never heard of this before ? 
do you know britney spears ? 
i 'm like , what ? no . why ? 
it will prove to the world that anybody can do this . 
i was like , well i 'm not britney spears , but maybe you could teach me .
i mean , you 've got to start somewhere , right ? 
and that was the beginning of a very strange journey for me .
i ended up spending the better part of the next year not only training my memory , but also investigating it , trying to understand how it works , why it sometimes doesn 't work and what its potential might be .
i met a host of really interesting people .
this is a guy called e .p .
his memory was so bad that he didn 't even remember he had a memory problem , which is amazing .
and he was this incredibly tragic figure , but he was a window into the extent to which our memories make us who we are .
the other end of the spectrum i met this guy .
this is kim peek .
we spent an afternoon together in the salt lake city public library memorizing phone books , which was scintillating .
and i learned a whole bunch of really interesting stuff .
these technologies have made our modern world possible , but they 've also changed us .
they 've changed us culturally , and i would argue that they 've changed us cognitively .
having little need to remember anymore , it sometimes seems like we 've forgotten how .
it 's actually not that singular , there are contests held all over the world .
and i was fascinated , i wanted to know how do these guys do it .
they wanted to know do these guys have brains that are somehow structurally , anatomically different from the rest of ours ?
the answer was no .
are they smarter than the rest of us ?
of note , they were using , or they seemed to be using , a part of the brain that 's involved in spatial memory and navigation .
why ? and is there something the rest of us can learn from this ?
yeah .
and it 's well illustrated by a nifty paradox known as the baker baker paradox , which goes like this if i tell two people to remember the same word , if i say to you , remember that there is a guy named baker . 
that 's his name .
and i say to you , remember that there is a guy who is a baker . 
and i come back to you at some point later on , and i say , do you remember that word that i told you a while back ?
do you remember what it was ? 
same word , different amount of remembering that 's weird .
what 's going on here ?
well the name baker doesn 't actually mean anything to you .
but the common noun baker , we know bakers .
bakers wear funny white hats .
bakers have flour on their hands .
bakers smell good when they come home from work .
maybe we even know a baker .
one of the more elaborate techniques for doing this dates back , years to ancient greece .
he was actually the hired entertainment , because back then if you wanted to throw a really slamming party , you didn 't hire a d .j . , you hired a poet .
nobody can say who was inside , nobody can say where they were sitting .
the bodies can 't be properly buried .
it 's one tragedy compounding another .
but i would wager that if i asked you to recall who is sitting on top of a talking tan horse in your foyer right now , you would be able to see that .
this is advice that goes back , plus years to the earliest latin memory treatises .
so how does this work ?
what you might do is picture yourself at the front door of your house .
and you 'd come up with some sort of an absolutely crazy , ridiculous , unforgettable image to remind you that the first thing you want to talk about is this totally bizarre contest .
and then you 'd go inside your house , and you would see an image of cookie monster on top of mister ed .
and that would remind you that you would want to then introduce your friend ed cook .
and then you 'd see an image of britney spears to remind you of this funny anecdote you want to tell .
and you go into your kitchen , and the fourth topic you were going to talk about was this strange journey that you went on for a year , and you have some friends to help you remember that .
i thought this was just fascinating , and i got really into it .
and i went to a few more of these memory contests .
but there was a problem .
truly , it is like a bunch of people sitting around taking the sats .
i mean , the most dramatic it gets is when somebody starts massaging their temples .
and i 'm a journalist , i need something to write about .
and i realized , if i was going to tell this story , i needed to walk in their shoes a little bit .
and so i started trying to spend or minutes every morning before i sat down with my new york times just trying to remember something .
maybe it was a poem .
maybe it was names from an old yearbook that i bought at a flea market .
and i found that this was shockingly fun .
i never would have expected that .
it was fun because this is actually not about training your memory .
and i got pretty into it .
i ended up coming back to that same contest that i had covered a year earlier .
problem was the experiment went haywire .
i won the contest , which really wasn 't supposed to happen .
these are just tricks .
they are tricks that work because they 're based on some pretty basic principles about how our brains work .
we often talk about people with great memories as though it were some sort of an innate gift , but that is not the case .
at the most basic level , we remember when we pay attention .
we remember when we are deeply engaged .
in fact , they 're not even really shortcuts .
they work because they make you work .
they force a kind of depth of processing , a kind of mindfulness , that most of us don 't normally walk around exercising .
but there actually are no shortcuts .
this is how stuff is made memorable .
i learned firsthand that there are incredible memory capacities latent in all of us .
thank you .
and like any teacher , i made quizzes and tests .
i gave out homework assignments .
when the work came back , i calculated grades .
what struck me was that i .q . was not the only difference between my best and my worst students .
some of my smartest kids weren 't doing so well .
and that got me thinking .
but these concepts are not impossible , and i was firmly convinced that every one of my students could learn the material if they worked hard and long enough .
after several more years of teaching , i came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a much better understanding of students and learning from a motivational perspective , from a psychological perspective .
in education , the one thing we know how to measure best is i .q . , but what if doing well in school and in life depends on much more than your ability to learn quickly and easily ?
so i left the classroom , and i went to graduate school to become a psychologist .
i started studying kids and adults in all kinds of super challenging settings , and in every study my question was , who is successful here and why ?
we went to the national spelling bee and tried to predict which children would advance farthest in competition .
we partnered with private companies , asking , which of these salespeople is going to keep their jobs ?
and who 's going to earn the most money ?
in all those very different contexts , one characteristic emerged as a significant predictor of success .
and it wasn 't social intelligence .
it wasn 't good looks , physical health , and it wasn 't i .q .
it was grit .
grit is passion and perseverance for very long term goals .
grit is living life like it 's a marathon , not a sprint .
a few years ago , i started studying grit in the chicago public schools .
to me , the most shocking thing about grit is how little we know , how little science knows , about building it .
every day , parents and teachers ask me , how do i build grit in kids ?
what do i do to teach kids a solid work ethic ?
the honest answer is , i don 't know .
what i do know is that talent doesn 't make you gritty .
our data show very clearly that there are many talented individuals who simply do not follow through on their commitments .
so far , the best idea i 've heard about building grit in kids is something called growth mindset . 
this is an idea developed at stanford university by carol dweck , and it is the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed , that it can change with your effort .
dr . dweck has shown that when kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to challenge , they 're much more likely to persevere when they fail , because they don 't believe that failure is a permanent condition .
so growth mindset is a great idea for building grit .
but we need more .
and that 's where i 'm going to end my remarks , because that 's where we are .
that 's the work that stands before us .
we need to take our best ideas , our strongest intuitions , and we need to test them .
we need to measure whether we 've been successful , and we have to be willing to fail , to be wrong , to start over again with lessons learned .
thank you .
both projects are in emerging countries , one in ethiopia and another one in tunisia .
and also they have in common that the different analyses from different perspectives becomes an essential part of the final piece of architecture .
and this is the type of building we were shown as an example , to my team and myself , of what we had to design .
at first , the first thing i thought was , i want to run away .
after seeing a few of these buildings there are many in the city we realized that they have three very big points .
first , these buildings , they are almost empty because they have very large shops where people cannot afford to buy things .
second , they need tons of energy to perform because of the skin treatment with glass that creates heat in the inside , and then you need a lot of cooling .
in a city where this shouldn 't happen because they have really mild weather that ranges from to degrees the whole year .
and third is that their image has nothing to do with africa and with ethiopia .
it is a pity in a place that has such rich culture and traditions .
and also it has this idea of the public space that uses the outdoors to create activity .
so i thought , this is what i really want to design , not a shopping mall .
so the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two streets , putting all the entrances of the building .
and this extends with an inclined atrium that creates an open air space in the building that self protects itself with its own shape from the sun and the rain .
i also thought , how to close the building ?
that they have fractal geometry properties and this helped me to shape the whole facade .
and we are building that with these small prefabricated pieces that are the windows that let the air and the light in a controlled way inside the building .
with these ideas it was not easy first to convince the developers because they were like , this is not a shopping mall . we didn 't ask for that . 
and also that the idea of the facade was much , much cheaper , not only because of the material compared with the glass , but also because we didn 't need to have air conditioning anymore .
so we created some budget savings that we used to implement the project .
so we created a huge asset by placing photovoltaics there on the roof .
hopefully by the beginning of next year , because we are already on the fifth floor of the construction .
the second example is a master plan of , apartments and facilities in the city of tunis .
and for doing such a big project , the biggest project i 've ever designed , i really needed to understand the city of tunis , but also its surroundings and the tradition and culture .
during that analysis i paid special attention to the medina that is this , year old structure that used to be closed by a wall , opened by twelve different gates , connected by almost straight lines .
when i went to the site , the first design operation we did was to extend the existing streets , creating initial blocks similar in size and characteristics to the ones we have in barcelona and other cities in europe with these courtyards .
on top of that , we selected some strategic points reminded of this idea of the gates and connecting them by straight lines , and this modified this initial pattern .
and for that i thought , what would be the best orientation in the mediterranean climate for an apartment ?
so we overlap a pattern that makes sure that most of the apartments are perfectly oriented in that direction .
and this is the result that is almost like a combination of the european block and the arab city .
it has these blocks with courtyards , and then on the ground floor you have all these connections for the pedestrians .
and also it responds to the local regulations that establish a higher density on the upper levels and a lower density on the ground floor .
and it also reinforces this idea of the gates .
the roof , which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving back to the community the space taken by the construction .
these two examples , they have a common approach in the design process .
and also , they are in emerging countries where you can see the cities literally growing .
in these cities , the impact of architecture in people 's lives of today and tomorrow changes the local communities and economies at the same speed as the buildings grow .
for this reason , i see even more importance to look at architecture finding simple but affordable solutions that enhance the relationship between the community and the environment and that aim to connect nature and people .
thank you very much .
so i 'm going to talk about trust , and i 'm going to start by reminding you of the standard views that people have about trust .
i think these are so commonplace , they 've become clich s of our society .
and i think there are three .
one 's a claim there has been a great decline in trust , very widely believed .
the second is an aim we should have more trust .
and the third is a task we should rebuild trust .
so what i 'm going to try to tell you today is a different story about a claim , an aim and a task which i think give one quite a lot better purchase on the matter .
first the claim why do people think trust has declined ?
and if i really think about it on the basis of my own evidence , i don 't know the answer .
i 'm inclined to think it may have declined in some activities or some institutions and it might have grown in others .
i don 't have an overview .
but , of course , i can look at the opinion polls , and the opinion polls are supposedly the source of a belief that trust has declined .
when you actually look at opinion polls across time , there 's not much evidence for that .
that 's to say , the people who were mistrusted years ago , principally journalists and politicians , are still mistrusted .
and the people who were highly trusted years ago are still rather highly trusted judges , nurses .
the rest of us are in between , and by the way , the average person in the street is almost exactly midway .
but is that good evidence ?
what opinion polls record is , of course , opinions .
what else can they record ?
so they 're looking at the generic attitudes that people report when you ask them certain questions .
do you trust politicians ? do you trust teachers ?
now if somebody said to you , do you trust greengrocers ?
you would probably begin by saying , to do what ? 
and that would be a perfectly sensible response .
and you might say , when you understood the answer to that , well , i trust some of them , but not others . 
that 's a perfectly rational thing .
in short , in our real lives , we seek to place trust in a differentiated way .
we don 't make an assumption that the level of trust that we will have in every instance of a certain type of official or office holder or type of person is going to be uniform .
i might , for example , say that i certainly trust a certain elementary school teacher i know to teach the reception class to read , but in no way to drive the school minibus .
i might , after all , know that she wasn 't a good driver .
simple .
so if we 've got those evidence in our ordinary lives of the way that trust is differentiated , why do we sort of drop all that intelligence when we think about trust more abstractly ?
secondly , what about the aim ?
the aim is to have more trust .
well frankly , i think that 's a stupid aim .
it 's not what i would aim at .
more trust is not an intelligent aim in this life .
intelligently placed and intelligently refused trust is the proper aim .
well once one says that , one says , yeah , okay , that means that what matters in the first place is not trust but trustworthiness .
it 's judging how trustworthy people are in particular respects .
and i think that judgment requires us to look at three things .
are they competent ? are they honest ? are they reliable ?
and if we find that a person is competent in the relevant matters , and reliable and honest , we 'll have a pretty good reason to trust them , because they 'll be trustworthy .
but if , on the other hand , they 're unreliable , we might not .
i have friends who are competent and honest , but i would not trust them to post a letter , because they 're forgetful .
i have friends who are very confident they can do certain things , but i realize that they overestimate their own competence .
and i 'm very glad to say , i don 't think i have many friends who are competent and reliable but extremely dishonest .
if so , i haven 't yet spotted it .
but that 's what we 're looking for trustworthiness before trust .
trust is the response .
trustworthiness is what we have to judge . and , of course , it 's difficult .
a lot of these systems have the converse effect .
they don 't work as they 're supposed to .
i remember i was talking with a midwife who said , well , you see , the problem is it takes longer to do the paperwork than to deliver the baby . 
and all over our public life , our institutional life , we find that problem , that the system of accountability that is meant to secure trustworthiness and evidence of trustworthiness is actually doing the opposite .
it is distracting people who have to do difficult tasks , like midwives , from doing them by requiring them to tick the boxes , as we say .
you can all give your own examples there .
so so much for the aim .
the aim , i think , is more trustworthiness , and that is going to be different if we are trying to be trustworthy and communicate our trustworthiness to other people , and if we are trying to judge whether other people or office holders or politicians are trustworthy .
it 's not easy . it is judgment , and simple reaction , attitudes , don 't do adequately here .
now thirdly , the task .
calling the task rebuilding trust , i think , also gets things backwards .
it suggests that you and i should rebuild trust .
well , we can do that for ourselves .
we can rebuild a bit of trustworthiness .
we can do it two people together trying to improve trust .
but trust , in the end , is distinctive because it 's given by other people .
you can 't rebuild what other people give you .
you have to give them the basis for giving you their trust .
so you have to , i think , be trustworthy .
and that , of course , is because you can 't fool all of the people all of the time , usually .
but you also have to provide usable evidence that you are trustworthy .
how to do it ?
well every day , all over the place , it 's being done by ordinary people , by officials , by institutions , quite effectively .
let me give you a simple commercial example .
the shop where i buy my socks says i may take them back , and they don 't ask any questions .
they take them back and give me the money or give me the pair of socks of the color i wanted .
that 's super . i trust them because they have made themselves vulnerable to me .
i think there 's a big lesson in that .
if you make yourself vulnerable to the other party , then that is very good evidence that you are trustworthy and you have confidence in what you are saying .
so in the end , i think what we are aiming for is not very difficult to discern .
so the moral of all this is , we need to think much less about trust , let alone about attitudes of trust detected or mis detected by opinion polls , much more about being trustworthy , and how you give people adequate , useful and simple evidence that you 're trustworthy .
thanks .
it totally dominated her imagination for months .
but you watch that movie enough times , and you start to realize how unusual it is .
but the wizard of oz stood alone .
it did not start that trend .
forty years later was when the trend really caught on , with , interestingly , another movie that featured a metal guy and a furry guy rescuing a girl by dressing up as the enemy 's guards .
do you know what i 'm talking about ?
yeah .
now , there 's a big difference between these two movies , a couple of really big differences between the wizard of oz and all the movies we watch today .
one is there 's very little violence in the wizard of oz . 
the monkeys are rather aggressive , as are the apple trees .
use your magic slippers to defeat the computer generated armies of the wicked witch . 
but that 's not how it happens .
now i started to notice this when i actually showed star wars to my daughter , which was years later , and the situation was different .
at that point i also had a son .
he was only three at the time .
but he was the second child , and the level of supervision had plummeted .
and i wonder what he 's soaking in .
is he picking up on the themes of courage and perseverance and loyalty ?
is he picking up on the fact that luke joins an army to overthrow the government ?
compare this to with the wizard of oz . 
how does dorothy win her movie ?
that 's kind of the world i 'd rather raise my kids in oz , right ? and not the world of dudes fighting , which is where we kind of have to be .
there is a lot of great writing about the impact that the boy violent movie has on girls , and you should do that reading . it 's very good .
i haven 't read as much on how boys are picking up on this vibe .
i finished my quest , i got the girl .
why are you still standing there ?
i don 't know what i 'm supposed to do .
the movies are very , very focused on defeating the villain and getting your reward , and there 's not a lot of room for other relationships and other journeys .
there are plenty of exceptions , and i will defend the disney princesses in front of any you .
but they do send a message to boys , that they are not , the boys are not really the target audience .
they are doing a phenomenal job of teaching girls how to defend against the patriarchy , but they are not necessarily showing boys how they 're supposed to defend against the patriarchy .
there 's no models for them .
and , of course , the most successful studio of all time continues to crank out classic after classic , every single one of them about the journey of a boy , or a man , or two men who are friends , or a man and his son , or two men who are raising a little girl .
i recommend it to all of you . it 's on demand now .
 aw , i can 't believe pixar made a princess movie . 
it 's very good . don 't let that stop you .
i don 't know if you 've heard of this .
it has not yet caught on and caught fire , but maybe today we will start a movement .
and it 's very simple . there 's just three questions you should ask is there more than one character in the movie that is female who has lines ?
so try to meet that bar .
and do these women talk to each other at any point in the movie ?
and is their conversation about something other than the guy that they both like ?
right ? thank you .
thank you very much .
two women who exist and talk to each other about stuff .
it does happen . i 've seen it , and yet i very rarely see it in the movies that we know and love .
in fact , this week i went to see a very high quality movie , argo . 
we 've got quite a few scenes of the men having deep , angst ridden conversations in this hideout , and the great moment for one of the actresses is to peek through the door and say , are you coming to bed , honey ? 
that 's hollywood for you .
so let 's look at the numbers .
eleven . it 's not bad .
but there is a number that is greater than this that 's going to bring this room down .
last year , the new york times published a study that the government had done .
here 's what it said .
one out of five women in america say that they have been sexually assaulted some time in their life .
who are these guys ? what are they learning ?
what are they failing to learn ?
are they absorbing the story that a male hero 's job is to defeat the villain with violence and then collect the reward , which is a woman who has no friends and doesn 't speak ?
are we soaking up that story ?
you know , as a parent with the privilege of raising a daughter like all of you who are doing the same thing , we find this world and this statistic very alarming and we want to prepare them .
i mean , i think the netflix queue is one way that we can do something very important , and i 'm talking mainly to the dads here .
i think we have got to show our sons a new definition of manhood .
the definition of manhood is already turning upside down .
they 're throwing it up in the air .
so our sons are going to have to find some way of adapting to this , some new relationship with each other , and i think we really have to show them , and model for them , how a real man is someone who trusts his sisters and respects them , and wants to be on their team , and stands up against the real bad guys , who are the men who want to abuse the women .
when i asked my daughter who her favorite character was in star wars , do you know what she said ?
obi wan .
what do these two have in common ?
maybe it 's not just the sparkly dress .
i think these people are experts .
i think these are the two people in the movie who know more than anybody else , and they love sharing their knowledge with other people to help them reach their potential .
now , they are leaders .
i like that kind of quest for my daughter , and i like that kind of quest for my son .
i want more quests like that .
i want fewer quests where my son is told , go out and fight it alone , and more quests where he sees that it 's his job to join a team , maybe a team led by women , to help other people become better and be better people , like the wizard of oz .
thank you .
i don 't know his name , but i do know his story .
he lives in a small village in southern somalia .
his village is near mogadishu .
with nothing left for him there , he leaves for the big city , in this case , mogadishu , the capital of somalia .
when he arrives , there are no opportunities , no jobs , no way forward .
he ends up living in a tent city on the outskirts of mogadishu .
maybe a year passes , nothing .
one day , he 's approached by a gentleman who offers to take him to lunch , then to dinner , to breakfast .
he meets this dynamic group of people , and they give him a break .
he 's given a bit of money to buy himself some new clothes , money to send back home to his family .
he is introduced to this young woman .
he eventually gets married .
he starts this new life .
he has a purpose in life .
he was waiting .
he was waiting for an opportunity , waiting to begin his future , waiting for a way forward , and this was the first thing that came along .
and his story repeats itself in urban centers around the world .
often it 's youth who suffer from the highest unemployment rates .
by , three out of five people living in cities will be under the age of .
and in my city of birth , mogadishu , percent of young people suffer from unemployment .
 percent don 't work , don 't go to school .
they pretty much do nothing .
would i have become a terrorist ?
i 'm not really sure about the answer .
i brought together about young somali leaders .
we sat down and brainstormed on solutions to the biggest challenges facing their city .
one of the young men in the room was aden .
he went to university in mogadishu , graduated .
there were no jobs , no opportunities .
i remember him telling me , because he was a college graduate , unemployed , frustrated , that he was the perfect target for al shabaab and other terrorist organizations , to be recruited .
they sought people like him out .
but his story takes a different route .
in mogadishu , the biggest barrier to getting from point a to point b are the roads .
aden saw an opportunity and seized it .
he began renting out motorbikes to local residents who couldn 't normally afford them .
he bought bikes , with the help of family and friends , and his dream is to eventually expand to several hundred within the next three years .
how is this story different ?
what makes his story different ?
i believe it is his ability to identify and seize a new opportunity .
it empowers young people to be the creators of the very economic opportunities they are so desperately seeking .
and you can train young people to be entrepreneurs .
he was helping me train some of the young people at the summit in entrepreneurship and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of entrepreneurship .
so mohamed saw an opportunity .
and he began delivering flowers to weddings , creating gardens at homes and businesses around the city , and he 's now working on creating mogadishu 's first public park in years .
there 's no public park in mogadishu .
he wants to create a space where families , young people , can come together , and , as he says , smell the proverbial roses .
and he doesn 't grow roses because they use too much water , by the way .
they had never really thought about starting up a business .
they 've thought about working for an ngo , working for the government , but his story , his innovation , really had a strong impact on them .
he forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunity .
he empowered them to believe that they could be entrepreneurs , that they could be change makers .
by the end of the day , they were coming up with innovative solutions to some of the biggest challenges facing their city .
they came up with entrepreneurial solutions to local problems .
connect young people with the resources they need , provide them the support they need to go from ideation to creation , and you will create catalysts for urban growth .
it 's about creating a social impact .
mohamed is not simply selling flowers .
i believe he is selling hope .
these young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact in their cities .
thank you .
but you know , these shells , they 're hard to find .
they 're covered in sand . they 're difficult to see .
however , overtime , i got used to looking for them .
i started seeing shapes and patterns that helped me to collect them .
this grew into a passion for finding things , a love for the past and archaeology .
this is really what brought me to using satellite imagery .
so i want to show you an example of how we see differently using the infrared .
and the site visibly appears brown , but when we use the infrared and we process it , all of the sudden , using false color , the site appears as bright pink .
what you are seeing are the actual chemical changes to the landscape caused by the building materials and activities of the ancient egyptians .
this area is huge it 's four miles by three miles in size .
we started to be able to see where the nile used to flow .
we also have evidence of an elite jewelers workshop , showing that whatever was there was a very important city .
there 's nothing like it in the land . 
so as it turns out , ted was not founded in ad .
making ideas actually started in bc at a not lost for long city , found from above .
thank you very much .
thank you .
ever since then , i was fascinated by this incredible language .
over the past few years , i 've been wondering if i can break down this wall , so anyone who wants to understand and appreciate the beauty of this sophisticated language could do so .
i started thinking about how a new , fast method of learning chinese might be useful .
i learned new characters every day during the course of the next years .
since we only have five minutes , it 's better that we have a fast and simpler way .
a chinese scholar would understand , characters .
today i 'm going to start with eight to show you how the method works .
you are ready ?
open your mouth as wide as possible until it 's square .
you get a mouth .
this is a person going for a walk .
person .
this is a tree .
tree .
this is a mountain .
the sun .
the moon .
i call these eight characters radicals .
a person .
if someone walks behind , that is to follow . 
as the old saying goes , two is company , three is a crowd .
the person inside the mouth , the person is trapped .
he 's a prisoner , just like jonah inside the whale .
three trees together , we create the forest .
put a plank underneath the tree , we have the foundation .
remember fire ?
two fires together , i get really hot .
three fires together , that 's a lot of flames .
set the fire underneath the two trees , it 's burning .
for us , the sun is the source of prosperity .
two suns together , prosperous .
put the sun and the moon shining together , it 's brightness .
it also means tomorrow , after a day and a night .
the sun is coming up above the horizon . sunrise .
a door . put a plank inside the door , it 's a door bolt .
put a mouth inside the door , asking questions .
knock knock . is anyone home ?
this person is sneaking out of a door , escaping , evading .
on the left , we have a woman .
two women together , they have an argument .
three women together , be careful , it 's adultery .
so we have gone through almost characters .
by using this method , the first eight radicals will allow you to build .
the next group of eight characters will build an extra .
so with very little effort , you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters , which is the same as a chinese eight year old .
so after we know the characters , we start building phrases .
this is a sun placed with the origin , because japan lies to the east of china .
so a sun , origin together , we build japan .
a person behind japan , what do we get ?
a japanese person .
nowadays , exile has turned into getting out .
a mouth which tells you where to get out is an exit .
this is a slide to remind me that i should stop talking and get off of the stage . thank you .
and the source was a man , an african american man , charming , rugged , homeless , playing a violin that only had two strings .
nathaniel dropped out of juilliard , he suffered a complete breakdown , and years later he was living homeless on the streets of skid row in downtown los angeles .
he had just heard a performance of beethoven 's first and fourth symphonies , and came backstage and introduced himself .
and we got talking about music , and i got an email from steve a few days later saying that nathaniel was interested in a violin lesson with me .
now , i should mention that nathaniel refuses treatment because when he was treated it was with shock therapy and thorazine and handcuffs , and that scar has stayed with him for his entire life .
and he was talking about invisible demons and smoke , and how someone was poisoning him in his sleep .
so , i just started playing .
and i played the first movement of the beethoven violin concerto .
and as i played , i understood that there was a profound change occurring in nathaniel 's eyes .
it was as if he was in the grip of some invisible pharmaceutical , a chemical reaction , for which my playing the music was its catalyst .
and i understood that he not only had an encyclopedic knowledge of music , but he related to this music at a personal level .
he spoke about it with the kind of passion and understanding that i share with my colleagues in the los angeles philharmonic .
music is medicine . music changes us .
and for nathaniel , music is sanity .
because music allows him to take his thoughts and delusions and shape them through his imagination and his creativity , into reality .
and i understood that this was the very essence of art .
this was the very reason why we made music , that we take something that exists within all of us at our very fundamental core , our emotions , and through our artistic lens , through our creativity , we 're able to shape those emotions into reality .
and the reality of that expression reaches all of us and moves us , inspires and unites us .
and for nathaniel , music brought him back into a fold of friends .
thank you .
bruno giussani thank you . thanks .
robert gupta .
so , please forgive me .
so , i 've known a lot of fish in my life .
i 've loved only two .
that first one , it was more like a passionate affair .
what a fish .
so you could feel good about selling it .
i was in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
one day , the head of the company called and asked if i 'd speak at an event about the farm 's sustainability .
 absolutely , i said .
here was a company trying to solve what 's become this unimaginable problem for us chefs how do we keep fish on our menus ?
for the past years , we 've been fishing the seas like we clear cut forests .
it 's hard to overstate the destruction .
there 's almost nothing left .
that means it takes fifteen pounds of wild fish to get you one pound of farm tuna .
not very sustainable .
it doesn 't taste very good either .
so here , finally , was a company trying to do it right .
i wanted to support them .
the day before the event , i called the head of p .r . for the company .
let 's call him don .
 don , i said , just to get the facts straight , you guys are famous for farming so far out to sea , you don 't pollute . 
 that 's right , he said . we 're so far out , the waste from our fish gets distributed , not concentrated . 
and then he added , we 're basically a world unto ourselves .
 best in the business . 
 . to one , great .
 . what ? what are you feeding ? 
 sustainable proteins , he said .
 great , i said . got off the phone .
and that night , i was lying in bed , and i thought what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
so the next day , just before the event , i called don .
i said , don , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? 
he said he didn 't know . he would ask around .
well , i got on the phone with a few people in the company no one could give me a straight answer until finally , i got on the phone with the head biologist .
let 's call him don too .
 don , i said , what are some examples of sustainable proteins ? 
i said , chicken pellets ? 
i said , what percentage of your feed is chicken ? 
thinking , you know , two percent .
 well , it 's about percent , he said .
i said , don , what 's sustainable about feeding chicken to fish ? 
there was a long pause on the line , and he said , there 's just too much chicken in the world . 
i actually am .
this second fish , it 's a different kind of love story .
it 's the romantic kind , the kind where the more you get to know your fish , you love the fish .
i first ate it at a restaurant in southern spain .
a journalist friend had been talking about this fish for a long time .
she kind of set us up .
it came to the table a bright , almost shimmering , white color .
like twice over .
amazingly , it was still delicious .
i can 't , but this guy can .
let 's call him miguel actually his name is miguel .
and no , he didn 't cook the fish , and he 's not a chef , at least in the way that you and i understand it .
they built this intricate series of canals , and they pushed water off the land and out into the river .
well , they couldn 't make it work , not economically .
and ecologically , it was a disaster .
it killed like percent of the birds , which , for this place , is a lot of birds .
and so in , a spanish company with an environmental conscience purchased the land .
what did they do ?
they reversed the flow of water .
they literally flipped the switch .
the farm 's incredible .
i mean , you 've never seen anything like this .
i was there not long ago with miguel .
and here , here he sees a grouping pattern that reminds him of the tanzanian giraffe .
i asked him how he became such an expert on fish .
he said , fish ? i didn 't know anything about fish .
i 'm an expert in relationships . 
it 's great , but i was in love .
so i interrupted him . i said , miguel , what makes your fish taste so good ? 
he pointed at the algae .
 i know , dude , the algae , the phytoplankton , the relationships it 's amazing .
but what are your fish eating ?
well , he goes on to tell me it 's such a rich system that the fish are eating what they 'd be eating in the wild .
the plant biomass , the phytoplankton , the zooplankton , it 's what feeds the fish .
there is no feed .
ever heard of a farm that doesn 't feed its animals ?
later that day , i was driving around this property with miguel , and i asked him , i said , for a place that seems so natural , unlike like any farm i 'd ever been at , how do you measure success ? 
and we rounded the corner and saw the most amazing sight thousands and thousands of pink flamingos , a literal pink carpet for as far as you could see .
 that 's success , he said .
 look at their bellies , pink .
 yes , he said .
well , last year , this property had , birds on it , more than different species .
he shook his head , no .
this is an ecological network .
the flamingos eat the shrimp .
the shrimp eat the phytoplankton .
so the pinker the belly , the better the system . 
okay , so let 's review a farm that doesn 't feed its animals , and a farm that measures its success on the health of its predators .
oh , and by the way , those flamingos , they shouldn 't even be there in the first place .
they brood in a town miles away , where the soil conditions are better for building nests .
every morning , they fly miles into the farm .
and every evening , they fly miles back .
they do that because they 're able to follow the broken white line of highway a .
no kidding .
i was imagining a march of the penguins thing , so i looked at miguel .
i said , miguel , do they fly miles to the farm , and then do they fly miles back at night ?
do they do that for the children ? 
he looked at me like i had just quoted a whitney houston song .
he said , no they do it because the food 's better . 
i almost never cook with it .
it tasted sweet and clean , like you were taking a bite of the ocean .
i mentioned that to miguel , and he nodded .
he said , the skin acts like a sponge .
it 's the last defense before anything enters the body .
ok . a farm that doesn 't feed its fish , a farm that measures its success by the success of its predators .
and when it works its way through the system and leaves , the water is cleaner than when it entered .
the system is so healthy , it purifies the water .
so , not just a farm that doesn 't feed its animals , not just a farm that measures its success by the health of its predators , but a farm that 's literally a water purification plant and not just for those fish , but for you and me as well .
what we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture , one in which the food actually tastes good .
but for a lot people , that 's a bit too radical .
and when you suggest these are the things that will ensure the future of good food , someone , somewhere stands up and says , hey guy , i love pink flamingos , but how are you going to feed the world ? 
how are you going to feed the world ?
can i be honest ?
i don 't love that question .
no , not because we already produce enough calories to more than feed the world .
one billion people will go hungry today .
now , i don 't love this question because it 's determined the logic of our food system for the last years .
that 's been the motivation , it 's been the justification it 's been the business plan of american agriculture .
that 's not a business , and it isn 't agriculture .
want to feed the world ?
let 's start by asking how are we going to feed ourselves ?
or better how can we create conditions that enable every community to feed itself ?
to do that , don 't look at the agribusiness model for the future .
it 's really old , and it 's tired .
instead , let 's look to the ecological model .
that 's the one that relies on two billion years of on the job experience .
look to miguel , farmers like miguel .
because they 're the ones that are experts in flavor , too .
and if i 'm going to be really honest , they 're a better chef than i 'll ever be .
you know , i 'm okay with that , because if that 's the future of good food , it 's going to be delicious .
thank you .
this tool that i 'm using here is a little experiment .
and , right away , i see there 's a different pattern that emerges .
if we go ahead and we filter by age say years or less we see that accidents are actually the greatest cause that people have to be worried about .
and if we can do this for raw data , why not do it for content as well ?
so what we have right here is the cover of every single sports illustrated ever produced .
it 's all here it 's all on the web .
you can go back to your rooms and try this after my talk .
you can drill into a particular year .
you can jump right into a specific issue .
so i 'm looking at this i see the athletes that have appeared in this issue , the sports .
i 'm a lance armstrong fan , so i 'll go ahead and i 'll click on that , which reveals , for me , all the issues in which lance armstrong 's been a part of .
so i can step back , and expand on that .
and so you get the idea that when you navigate over information this way going narrower , broader , backing in , backing out you 're not searching , you 're not browsing .
you 're doing something that 's actually a little bit different .
it 's in between , and we think it changes the way information can be used .
so i want to extrapolate on this idea a bit with something that 's a little bit crazy .
but even in this limited view , we can do a lot of things .
right away , we get a sense of what are the topical domains that are most popular on wikipedia .
it 's only possible to see that insight when you step back and look at all of them .
looking at one of these particular summaries , i can then drill into the concept of time magazine person of the year , bringing up all of them .
and interestingly enough , bono is also a ted prize winner .
so we can go , jump , and take a look at all the ted prize winners .
so you see , we 're navigating the web for the first time as if it 's actually a web , not from page to page , but at a higher level of abstraction .
and so i want to show you one other thing that may catch you a little bit by surprise .
i 'm just showing the new york times website here .
so i can step back , pop right back into a specific section .
now the reason why this is important is because , by virtue of just viewing web pages in this way , i can look at my entire browsing history in the exact same way .
so i can drill into what i 've done over specific time frames .
here , in fact , is the state of all the demo that i just gave .
and i can sort of replay some stuff that i was looking at earlier today .
and from these , i can drill into the web page and just launch them again .
it 's one metaphor repurposed multiple times , and in each case it makes the whole greater than the sum of the parts with the data .
so right now , in this world , we think about data as being this curse .
we talk about drowning in data .
what if we can actually turn that upside down and turn the web upside down , so that instead of navigating from one thing to the next , we get used to the habit of being able to go from many things to many things , and then being able to see the patterns that were otherwise hidden ?
and , instead of dealing just with information , we can tease out knowledge .
and if we get the knowledge , then maybe even there 's wisdom to be found .
so with that , i thank you .
i grew up on a steady diet of science fiction .
in high school , i took a bus to school an hour each way every day .
and i was always absorbed in a book , science fiction book , which took my mind to other worlds , and satisfied , in a narrative form , this insatiable sense of curiosity that i had .
but it was all about trying to understand the world , understand the limits of possibility .
and my love of science fiction actually seemed mirrored in the world around me , because what was happening , this was in the late ' s , we were going to the moon , we were exploring the deep oceans .
jacques cousteau was coming into our living rooms with his amazing specials that showed us animals and places and a wondrous world that we could never really have previously imagined .
and i was an artist .
i could draw . i could paint .
and i found that because there weren 't video games and this saturation of cg movies and all of this imagery in the media landscape , i had to create these images in my head .
you know , we all did , as kids having to read a book , and through the author 's description , put something on the movie screen in our heads .
and so , my response to this was to paint , to draw alien creatures , alien worlds , robots , spaceships , all that stuff .
that was the creativity had to find its outlet somehow .
and an interesting thing happened the jacques cousteau shows actually got me very excited about the fact that there was an alien world right here on earth .
i might not really go to an alien world on a spaceship someday that seemed pretty darn unlikely .
but that was a world i could really go to , right here on earth , that was as rich and exotic as anything that i had imagined from reading these books .
so , i decided i was going to become a scuba diver at the age of .
and the only problem with that was that i lived in a little village in canada , miles from the nearest ocean .
and i didn 't see the ocean , a real ocean , for another two years , until we moved to california .
since then , in the intervening years , i 've spent about , hours underwater , and hours of that was in submersibles .
i still , to this day , stand in absolute awe of what i see when i make these dives .
and my love affair with the ocean is ongoing , and just as strong as it ever was .
but when i chose a career as an adult , it was filmmaking .
and that seemed to be the best way to reconcile this urge i had to tell stories with my urges to create images .
and i was , as a kid , constantly drawing comic books , and so on .
so , filmmaking was the way to put pictures and stories together , and that made sense .
and of course the stories that i chose to tell were science fiction stories terminator , aliens and the abyss . 
and with the abyss , i was putting together my love of underwater and diving with filmmaking .
so , you know , merging the two passions .
and this resulted in the first soft surface character , cg animation that was ever in a movie .
and even though the film didn 't make any money barely broke even , i should say i witnessed something amazing , which is that the audience , the global audience , was mesmerized by this apparent magic .
they were seeing something magical .
and so that got me very excited .
and i thought , wow , this is something that needs to be embraced into the cinematic art . 
so , with terminator , which was my next film , we took that much farther .
and the concept of the company was that we would leapfrog past the analog processes of optical printers and so on , and we would go right to digital production .
and we actually did that and it gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
and the envelope pushed back , and i was told by the folks at my company that we weren 't going to be able to do this for a while .
so , i shelved it , and i made this other movie about a big ship that sinks .
secretly , what i wanted to do was i wanted to dive to the real wreck of titanic . 
and that 's why i made the movie .
and that 's the truth . now , the studio didn 't know that .
but i convinced them . i said , we 're going to dive to the wreck . we 're going to film it for real .
it will be really important . it will be a great marketing hook . 
and i talked them into funding an expedition .
sounds crazy . but this goes back to that theme about your imagination creating a reality .
not a movie , not hd for real .
now , that blew my mind .
and it took a lot of preparation , we had to build cameras and lights and all kinds of things .
you get in this capsule , you go down to this dark hostile environment where there is no hope of rescue if you can 't get back by yourself .
and i thought like , wow . i 'm like , living in a science fiction movie .
this is really cool . 
and so , i really got bitten by the bug of deep ocean exploration .
of course , the curiosity , the science component of it it was everything . it was adventure , it was curiosity , it was imagination .
and it was an experience that hollywood couldn 't give me .
because , you know , i could imagine a creature and we could create a visual effect for it . but i couldn 't imagine what i was seeing out that window .
so , i was completely smitten by this , and had to do more .
and so , i actually made a kind of curious decision .
after the success of titanic , i said , ok , i 'm going to park my day job as a hollywood movie maker , and i 'm going to go be a full time explorer for a while . 
we went back to the titanic wreck .
nobody had ever looked inside the wreck . they didn 't have the means to do it , so we created technology to do it .
when i say , i 'm operating it , but my mind is in the vehicle .
and the set was based as an exact replica on the blueprints of the ship .
so , it was this absolutely remarkable experience .
and it really made me realize that the telepresence experience that you actually can have these robotic avatars , then your consciousness is injected into the vehicle , into this other form of existence .
it was really , really quite profound .
they live in an environment of chemosynthesis .
they don 't survive on sunlight based system the way we do .
and so , you 're seeing animals that are living next to a degree centigrade you think they can 't possibly exist .
and this was fascinating .
i 'd completely closed the loop between being the science fiction fan , you know , as a kid , and doing this stuff for real .
and you know , along the way in this journey of discovery , i learned a lot .
i didn 't really learn about leadership until i did these expeditions .
because i had to , at a certain point , say , what am i doing out here ?
why am i doing this ? what do i get out of it ? 
we don 't make money at these damn shows .
we barely break even . there is no fame in it .
made all these films , made all these documentary films for a very limited audience .
no fame , no glory , no money . what are you doing ?
because we would do these things with , people , working for years at a time , sometimes at sea for two , three months at a time .
and in that bond , you realize that the most important thing is the respect that you have for them and that they have for you , that you 've done a task that you can 't explain to someone else .
creates a bond , creates a bond of respect .
so , when i came back to make my next movie , which was avatar , i tried to apply that same principle of leadership , which is that you respect your team , and you earn their respect in return .
and it really changed the dynamic .
so , here i was again with a small team , in uncharted territory , doing avatar , coming up with new technology that didn 't exist before .
tremendously exciting .
tremendously challenging .
and we became a family , over a four and half year period .
and it completely changed how i do movies .
so , what can we synthesize out of all this ?
you know , what are the lessons learned ?
well , i think number one is curiosity .
it 's the most powerful thing you own .
imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
and the respect of your team is more important than all the laurels in the world .
i have young filmmakers come up to me and say , give me some advice for doing this . 
and i say , don 't put limitations on yourself .
other people will do that for you don 't do it to yourself , don 't bet against yourself , and take risks . 
but failure has to be an option in art and in exploration , because it 's a leap of faith .
and no important endeavor that required innovation was done without risk .
you have to be willing to take those risks .
so , that 's the thought i would leave you with , is that in whatever you 're doing , failure is an option , but fear is not . thank you .
i 'm going to talk today about energy and climate .
but energy and climate are extremely important to these people in fact , more important than to anyone else on the planet .
so , the climate changes will be terrible for them .
and so , we 're in a wonderful situation with electricity in the rich world .
but , as we make it cheaper and let 's go for making it twice as cheap we need to meet a new constraint , and that constraint has to do with co .
co is warming the planet , and the equation on co is actually a very straightforward one .
and there 's certainly uncertainty about how bad those effects will be , but they will be extremely bad .
i asked the top scientists on this several times do we really have to get down to near zero ?
can 't we just cut it in half or a quarter ?
and the answer is that until we get near to zero , the temperature will continue to rise .
and so that 's a big challenge .
it 's very different than saying we 're a twelve foot high truck trying to get under a ten foot bridge , and we can just sort of squeeze under . 
this is something that has to get to zero .
now , we put out a lot of carbon dioxide every year , over billion tons .
for each american , it 's about tons for people in poor countries , it 's less than one ton .
it 's an average of about five tons for everyone on the planet .
and , somehow , we have to make changes that will bring that down to zero .
it 's been constantly going up .
so , let 's look at each one of these and see how we can get this down to zero .
probably , one of these numbers is going to have to get pretty near to zero .
now that 's back from high school algebra , but let 's take a look .
first , we 've got population .
the world today has . billion people .
that 's headed up to about nine billion .
the second factor is the services we use .
this encompasses everything the food we eat , clothing , tv , heating .
and it 's a great thing for this number to go up .
in the rich world , perhaps the top one billion , we probably could cut back and use less , but every year , this number , on average , is going to go up , and so , over all , that will more than double the services delivered per person .
here we have a very basic service do you have lighting in your house to be able to read your homework ?
now , efficiency , e , the energy for each service , here finally we have some good news .
we have something that 's not going up .
and so , overall here , if we 're optimistic , we may get a reduction of a factor of three to even , perhaps , a factor of six .
but for these first three factors now , we 've gone from billion to , at best , maybe billion tons , and that just won 't cut it .
and so the question is can you actually get that to zero ?
if you burn coal , no .
if you burn natural gas , no .
and so , what we 're going to have to do at a global scale , is create a new system .
now , when i use the term miracle , i don 't mean something that 's impossible .
the microprocessor is a miracle . the personal computer is a miracle .
the internet and its services are a miracle .
so , the people here have participated in the creation of many miracles .
usually , we don 't have a deadline , where you have to get the miracle by a certain date .
usually , you just kind of stand by , and some come along , some don 't .
this is a case where we actually have to drive at full speed and get a miracle in a pretty tight timeline .
now , i thought , how could i really capture this ?
is there some kind of natural illustration , some demonstration that would grab people 's imagination here ? 
i thought back to a year ago when i brought mosquitos , and somehow people enjoyed that .
it really got them involved in the idea of , you know , there are people who live with mosquitos .
so , with energy , all i could come up with is this .
so here we have some natural fireflies .
i 'm told they don 't bite in fact , they might not even leave that jar .
we need solutions either one or several that have unbelievable scale and unbelievable reliability , and , although there 's many directions people are seeking , i really only see five that can achieve the big numbers .
those may make some contribution , and if they can do better than i expect , so much the better , but my key point here is that we 're going to have to work on each of these five , and we can 't give up any of them because they look daunting , because they all have significant challenges .
let 's look first at the burning fossil fuels , either burning coal or burning natural gas .
who 's going to be sure ?
who 's going to guarantee something that is literally billions of times larger than any type of waste you think of in terms of nuclear or other things ?
this is a lot of volume .
so that 's a tough one .
next would be nuclear .
and then what do you do with the waste ?
and , although it 's not very large , there are a lot of concerns about that .
so three very tough problems that might be solvable , and so , should be worked on .
the last three of the five , i 've grouped together .
these are what people often refer to as the renewable sources .
and they actually although it 's great they don 't require fuel they have some disadvantages .
one is that the density of energy gathered in these technologies is dramatically less than a power plant .
this is energy farming , so you 're talking about many square miles , thousands of time more area than you think of as a normal energy plant .
also , these are intermittent sources .
the sun doesn 't shine all day , it doesn 't shine every day , and , likewise , the wind doesn 't blow all the time .
and so , if you depend on these sources , you have to have some way of getting the energy during those time periods that it 's not available .
and , to dimensionalize this , i went through and looked at all the types of batteries that get made for cars , for computers , for phones , for flashlights , for everything and compared that to the amount of electrical energy the world uses , and what i found is that all the batteries we make now could store less than minutes of all the energy .
and so , in fact , we need a big breakthrough here , something that 's going to be a factor of better than the approaches we have now .
it 's not impossible , but it 's not a very easy thing .
if you 're counting on it for percent , you need an incredible miracle battery .
now , how we 're going to go forward on this what 's the right approach ?
is it a manhattan project ? what 's the thing that can get us there ?
well , we need lots of companies working on this , hundreds .
in each of these five paths , we need at least a hundred people .
and a lot of them , you 'll look at and say , they 're crazy . that 's good .
and , i think , here in the ted group , we have many people who are already pursuing this .
nathan myhrvold and i actually are backing a company that , perhaps surprisingly , is actually taking the nuclear approach .
and innovation really stopped in this industry quite some ago , so the idea that there 's some good ideas laying around is not all that surprising .
it is kind of a crazy idea .
so , instead of worrying about them , you just take that . it 's a great thing .
it breathes this uranium as it goes along , so it 's kind of like a candle .
you can see it 's a log there , often referred to as a traveling wave reactor .
i 've got a picture here of a place in kentucky .
that would power the u .s . for hundreds of years .
so , you know , it 's got lots of challenges ahead , but it is an example of the many hundreds and hundreds of ideas that we need to move forward .
so let 's think how should we measure ourselves ?
what should our report card look like ?
well , let 's go out to where we really need to get , and then look at the intermediate .
for , you 've heard many people talk about this percent reduction .
that really is very important , that we get there .
so , the other grade is are we deploying this zero emission technology , have we deployed it in all the developed countries and we 're in the process of getting it elsewhere ?
that 's super important .
so , backing up from there , what should the report card look like ?
well , again , it should have the two elements .
but in some ways , the grade we get there , doing things that don 't get us all the way to the big reductions , is only equally , or maybe even slightly less , important than the other , which is the piece of innovation on these breakthroughs .
there 's a lot of great books that have been written about this .
they really go through it and create a framework that this can be discussed broadly , because we need broad backing for this .
there 's a lot that has to come together .
so this is a wish .
it 's a very concrete wish that we invent this technology .
this is the one with the greatest impact .
if we don 't get this wish , the division between the people who think short term and long term will be terrible , between the u .s . and china , between poor countries and rich , and most of all the lives of those two billion will be far worse .
so , what do we have to do ?
we need to go for more research funding .
we need to get the message out .
we need to have this dialogue be a more rational , more understandable dialogue , including the steps that the government takes .
this is an important wish , but it is one i think we can achieve .
thank you .
thank you .
thank you . thank you .
bil gates to actually do the software , buy the supercomputer , hire all the great scientists , which we 've done , that 's only tens of millions , and even once we test our materials out in a russian reactor to make sure that our materials work properly , then you 'll only be up in the hundreds of millions .
once you get the first one built , if it works as advertised , then it 's just clear as day , because the economics , the energy density , are so different than nuclear as we know it .
bg that 's right . today , you 're always refueling the reactor , so you have lots of people and lots of controls that can go wrong that thing where you 're opening it up and moving things in and out , that 's not good .
so , if you have very cheap fuel that you can put years in just think of it as a log put it down and not have those same complexities .
and it just sits there and burns for the years , and then it 's done .
it 's a nuclear power plant that is its own waste disposal solution .
bg yeah . well , what happens with the waste , you can let it sit there there 's a lot less waste under this approach then you can actually take that , and put it into another one and burn that .
i mean , you 're talking to different people around the world about the possibilities here .
where is there most interest in actually doing something with this ?
so i 'm optimistic . you know , the french and japanese have done some work .
this is a variant on something that has been done .
so , in your mind , timescale and likelihood of actually taking something like this live ?
and it 's best if multiple succeed , because then you could use a mix of these things .
we certainly need one to succeed .
in terms of big scale possible game changes , is this the biggest that you 're aware of out there ?
in the nuclear space , there are other innovators .
you know , we don 't know their work as well as we know this one , but the modular people , that 's a different approach .
if this doesn 't work , then what ?
bg if you get into that situation , it 's like if you 've been over eating , and you 're about to have a heart attack then where do you go ? you may need heart surgery or something .
you hope you don 't need to do that .
some people say you shouldn 't even work on the insurance policy because it might make you lazy , that you 'll keep eating because you know heart surgery will be there to save you .
climate skeptics if you had a sentence or two to say to them , how might you persuade them that they 're wrong ?
bg well , unfortunately , the skeptics come in different camps .
the ones who make scientific arguments are very few .
are they saying that there 's negative feedback effects that have to do with clouds that offset things ?
there are very , very few things that they can even say there 's a chance in a million of those things .
the main problem we have here , it 's kind of like aids .
you make the mistake now , and you pay for it a lot later .
and so , when you have all sorts of urgent problems , the idea of taking pain now that has to do with a gain later , and a somewhat uncertain pain thing in fact , the ipcc report , that 's not necessarily the worst case , and there are people in the rich world who look at ipcc and say , ok , that isn 't that big of a deal . 
the fact is it 's that uncertain part that should move us towards this .
bg well , the actual spending on the r amp d piece say the u .s . should spend billion a year more than it is right now it 's not that dramatic .
it shouldn 't take away from other things .
the thing you get into big money on , and this , reasonable people can disagree , is when you have something that 's non economic and you 're trying to fund that that , to me , mostly is a waste .
i mean , all of us here could pay five times as much for our energy and not change our lifestyle .
the disaster is for that two billion .
his shtick now is , why isn 't the r amp d getting more discussed ? 
and so there is a thread of something that i think is appropriate .
the r amp d piece , it 's crazy how little it 's funded .
well bill , i suspect i speak on the behalf of most people here to say i really hope your wish comes true . thank you so much .
bg thank you .
the marshmallow has to be on top .
and , though it seems really simple , it 's actually pretty hard because it forces people to collaborate very quickly .
and so , i thought this was an interesting idea , and i incorporated it into a design workshop .
and it was a huge success .
then they spend some time planning , organizing , they sketch and they lay out spaghetti .
they spend the majority of their time assembling the sticks into ever growing structures .
and then finally , just as they 're running out of time , someone takes out the marshmallow , and then they gingerly put it on top , and then they stand back , and ta da ! they admire their work .
but what really happens , most of the time , is that the ta da turns into an uh oh , because the weight of the marshmallow causes the entire structure to buckle and to collapse .
so there are a number of people who have a lot more uh oh moments than others , and among the worst are recent graduates of business school .
and of course there are teams that have a lot more ta da structures , and among the best are recent graduates of kindergarten .
and it 's pretty amazing .
as peter tells us , not only do they produce the tallest structures , but they 're the most interesting structures of them all .
so the question you want to ask is how come ? why ? what is it about them ?
but there 's another reason as well .
and the reason is that business students are trained to find the single right plan , right ?
and then they execute on it .
and then what happens is , when they put the marshmallow on the top , they run out of time and what happens ?
it 's a crisis .
sound familiar ? right .
and with each version , kids get instant feedback about what works and what doesn 't work .
so the capacity to play in prototype is really essential , but let 's look at how different teams perform .
who does the very best ?
architects and engineers , thankfully .
thirty nine inches is the tallest structure i 've seen .
so ceos , a little bit better than average , but here 's where it gets interesting .
if you put you put an executive admin . on the team , they get significantly better .
it 's incredible . you know , you look around , you go , oh , that team 's going to win . 
you can just tell beforehand . and why is that ?
they manage the process , they understand the process .
and any team who manages and pays close attention to work will significantly improve the team 's performance .
if you have teams that typically perform , you 'll get maybe six or so that have standing structures .
and i tried something interesting .
so i offered a , dollar prize of software to the winning team .
so what do you think happened to these design students ?
what was the result ?
here 's what happened not one team had a standing structure .
if anyone had built , say , a one inch structure , they would have taken home the prize .
we did the exercise again with the same students .
what do you think happened then ?
so now they understand the value of prototyping .
so the same team went from being the very worst to being among the very best .
they produced the tallest structures in the least amount of time .
so , you might ask why would anyone actually spend time writing a marshmallow challenge ?
and what the marshmallow challenge does is it helps them identify the hidden assumptions .
because , frankly , every project has its own marshmallow , doesn 't it ?
the challenge provides a shared experience , a common language , a common stance to build the right prototype .
and so , this is the value of the experience , of this so simple exercise .
it 's a blog that you can look at how to build the marshmallows .
there 's step by step instructions on this .
there are crazy examples from around the world of how people tweak and adjust the system .
it demands that we bring all of our senses to the task , and that we apply the very best of our thinking , our feeling and our doing to the challenge that we have at hand .
and sometimes , a little prototype of this experience is all that it takes to turn us from an uh oh moment to a ta da moment .
and that can make a big difference .
thank you very much .
let 's pretend right here we have a machine .
a big machine , a cool , ted ish machine , and it 's a time machine .
and everyone in this room has to get into it .
and you can go backwards , you can go forwards you cannot stay where you are .
and i wonder what you 'd choose , because i 've been asking my friends this question a lot lately and they all want to go back .
i don 't know . they want to go back before there were automobiles or twitter or american idol . 
i don 't know .
i 'm convinced that there 's some sort of pull to nostalgia , to wishful thinking .
and i understand that .
i 'm not part of that crowd , i have to say .
i don 't want to go back , and it 's not because i 'm adventurous .
it 's because possibilities on this planet , they don 't go back , they go forward .
so i want to get in the machine , and i want to go forward .
there 's never been a time like this .
my great grandparents died , all of them , by the time they were .
my grandparents pushed that number to .
my parents are closing in on .
but it 's not even about people like us , because this is a bigger deal than that .
a kid born in new delhi today can expect to live as long as the richest man in the world did years ago .
think about that , it 's an incredible fact .
and why is it true ?
smallpox . smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
it reshaped the demography of the globe in a way that no war ever has .
it 's gone . it 's vanished .
in the rich world , diseases that threatened millions of us just a generation ago no longer exist , hardly .
does anyone even know what those things are ?
vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , those are triumphs of the scientific method .
and to my mind , the scientific method trying stuff out , seeing if it works , changing it when it doesn 't is one of the great accomplishments of humanity .
so that 's the good news .
unfortunately , that 's all the good news because there are some other problems , and they 've been mentioned many times .
and one of them is that despite all our accomplishments , a billion people go to bed hungry in this world every day .
and not only that , we 've used our imagination to thoroughly trash this globe .
so the question is can we do that ? and i think we can .
i think it 's clear that we can make food that will feed billions of people without raping the land that they live on .
i think we can power this world with energy that doesn 't also destroy it .
i really do believe that , and , no , it ain 't wishful thinking .
but here 's the thing that keeps me up at night one of the things that keeps me up at night we 've never needed progress in science more than we need it right now . never .
people wrap themselves in their beliefs , and they do it so tightly that you can 't set them free .
not even the truth will set them free .
and , listen , everyone 's entitled to their opinion they 're even entitled to their opinion about progress .
but you know what you 're not entitled to ?
you 're not entitled to your own facts . sorry , you 're not .
and this took me awhile to figure out .
about a decade ago , i wrote a story about vaccines for the new yorker . a little story .
and i was amazed to find opposition opposition to what is , after all , the most effective public health measure in human history .
i didn 't know what to do , so i just did what i do i wrote a story and i moved on .
and soon after that , i wrote a story about genetically engineered food .
same thing , only bigger .
people were going crazy .
but , you know , i do what i do . i wrote the story , i moved on .
i mean , i 'm a journalist .
we type , we file , we go to dinner . it 's fine .
but these stories bothered me , and i couldn 't figure out why , and eventually i did .
and that 's because those fanatics that were driving me crazy weren 't actually fanatics at all .
they were thoughtful people , educated people , decent people .
they were exactly like the people in this room .
and it just disturbed me so much .
but then i thought , you know , let 's be honest .
we 're at a point in this world where we don 't have the same relationship to progress that we used to .
we talk about it in ironic terms with little quotes around it progress . 
okay , there are reasons for that , and i think we know what those reasons are .
we 've lost faith in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and there 's no reason we shouldn 't have .
you can just say a few names and people will understand .
you know , you can choose your list .
there are questions and problems with the people we used to believe were always right , so be skeptical .
ask questions , demand proof , demand evidence .
don 't take anything for granted .
but here 's the thing when you get proof , you need to accept the proof , and we 're not that good at doing that .
and the reason that i can say that is because we 're now in an epidemic of fear like one i 've never seen and hope never to see again .
very scary .
tons of studies were done to see if this was true .
tons of studies should have been done it 's a serious issue .
the data came back .
the data came back from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and it was all the same no correlation , no connection , none at all .
it doesn 't matter . it doesn 't matter because we believe anecdotes , we believe what we see , what we think we see , what makes us feel real .
but you know what ?
the result of that has been disastrous .
disastrous because here 's a fact the united states is one of the only countries in the world where the vaccine rate for measles is going down .
it 's horrible .
what kind of a thing happened that we could do that ?
now , i understand it . i do understand it .
because , did anyone have measles here ?
has one person in this audience ever seen someone die of measles ?
doesn 't happen very much .
doesn 't happen in this country at all , but it happened , times in the world last year .
that 's a lot of death of measles an hour .
but since it didn 't happen here , we can put it out of our minds , and people like jenny mccarthy can go around preaching messages of fear and illiteracy from platforms like oprah and larry king live . 
and they can do it because they don 't link causation and correlation .
they don 't understand that these things seem the same , but they 're almost never the same .
and it 's something we need to learn , and we need to learn it really soon .
this guy was a hero , jonas salk .
he took one of the worst scourges of mankind away from us .
no fear , no agony . polio puff , gone .
that guy in the middle , not so much .
his name is paul offit .
it 'll save the lives of to , kids in the developing world every year .
pretty good , right ?
well , it 's good , except that paul goes around talking about vaccines and says how valuable they are and that people ought to just stop the whining .
and he actually says it that way .
so , paul 's a terrorist .
when paul speaks in a public hearing , he can 't testify without armed guards .
he gets called at home because people like to tell him that they remember where his kids go to school .
and why ? because paul made a vaccine .
i don 't need to say this , but vaccines are essential .
you take them away , disease comes back , horrible diseases . and that 's happening .
we have measles in this country now .
and it 's getting worse , and pretty soon kids are going to die of it again because it 's just a numbers game .
and they 're not just going to die of measles .
what about polio ? let 's have that . why not ?
no one 's ever said that before .
she wasn 't going to vaccinate her kid against polio , no way .
fine .
why ? because we don 't have polio . and you know what ?
we didn 't have polio in this country yesterday .
today , i don 't know , maybe a guy got on a plane in lagos this morning , and he 's flying to lax , right now he 's over ohio .
and he 's going to land in a couple of hours , he 's going to rent a car , and he 's going to come to long beach , and he 's going to attend one of these fabulous ted dinners tonight .
and he doesn 't know that he 's infected with a paralytic disease , and we don 't either because that 's the way the world works .
that 's the planet we live on . don 't pretend it isn 't .
now , we love to wrap ourselves in lies . we love to do it .
everyone take their vitamins this morning ?
i know you did because half of americans do every day .
they take the stuff , and they take alternative medicines , and it doesn 't matter how often we find out that they 're useless .
the data says it all the time .
they darken your urine . they almost never do more than that .
it 's okay , you want to pay billion dollars for dark urine ?
i 'm totally with you .
dark urine . dark .
why do we do that ? why do we do that ?
well , i think i understand , we hate big pharma .
we hate big government . we don 't trust the man .
and we shouldn 't our health care system sucks .
it 's cruel to millions of people .
so we run away from it , and where do we run ?
we leap into the arms of big placebo .
that 's fantastic . i love big placebo .
but , you know , it 's really a serious thing because this stuff is crap , and we spend billions of dollars on it .
and i have all sorts of little props here .
and you know what ? when i say this stuff , people scream at me , and they say , what do you care ? let people do what they want to do .
it makes them feel good . 
and you know what ? you 're wrong .
when you start down the road where belief and magic replace evidence and science , you end up in a place you don 't want to be .
you end up in thabo mbeki south africa .
hundreds of thousands of needless deaths in a country that has been plagued worse than any other by this disease .
please , don 't tell me there are no consequences to these things .
there are . there always are .
it 's an idiotic debate . it has to stop .
it 's a debate about words , about metaphors .
it 's ideology , it 's not science .
there weren 't christmas trees . we made it all .
we made it over the last , years .
and some of it worked , and some of it didn 't .
we got rid of the stuff that didn 't .
now we can do it in a more precise way and there are risks , absolutely but we can put something like vitamin a into rice , and that stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , prolong their lives .
you don 't want to do that ?
i have to say , i don 't understand it .
we object to genetically engineered food .
why do we do that ?
we don 't companies patenting life .
we don 't want companies owning seeds .
and you know what my response to all of that is ?
yes , you 're right . let 's fix it .
this has nothing to do with science .
you know science isn 't a company .
it 's not a country .
it 's not even an idea it 's a process .
you know , in the next years we 're going to have to grow percent more food than we do right now , percent .
this investment in africa over the last years .
they need it , and we 're not giving it to them .
and why ? genetically engineered food .
cassava 's something that half a billion people eat .
it 's kind of like a potato .
it 's just a bunch of calories . it sucks .
it doesn 't have nutrients , it doesn 't have protein , and scientists are engineering all of that into it right now .
and then people would be able to eat it and they 'd be able to not go blind .
they wouldn 't starve , and you know what ?
that would be nice . it wouldn 't be chez panisse , but it would be nice .
and all i can say about this is why are we fighting it ?
i mean , let 's ask ourselves why are we fighting it ?
because we don 't want to move genes around ?
this is about moving genes around . it 's not about chemicals .
it 's not about our ridiculous passion for hormones , our insistence on having bigger food , better food , singular food .
because , you know something ?
if we don 't , if we continue to act the way we 're acting , we 're guilty of something that i don 't think we want to be guilty of high tech colonialism .
there 's no other way to describe what 's going on here .
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's beneath us , and we really have to stop it .
so after this amazingly fun conversation , you might want to say , so , you still want to get in this ridiculous time machine and go forward ? 
absolutely . absolutely , i do .
it 's stuck in the present right now , but we have an amazing opportunity .
we can set that time machine on anything we want .
we can move it where we want to move it , and we 're going to move it where we want to move it .
we have to have these conversations and we have to think , but when we get in the time machine and we go ahead , we 're going to be happy we do .
i know that we can , and as far as i 'm concerned , that 's something the world needs right now .
thank you .
thank you .
for some time i have been interested in the placebo effect , which might seem like an odd thing for a magician to be interested in , unless you think of it in the terms that i do , which is , something fake is believed in enough by somebody that it becomes something real . 
something fake becomes something real because of someone 's perception of it .
in order for us to understand each other , i want to start by showing you a rudimentary , very simple magic trick .
i 'll do it for you , and then i 'll explain it .
and then i 'll explain why i explained it .
so , here 's what happens .
the knife , which you can examine my hand , which you could examine .
i 'm just going to hold the knife in my fist like this .
i 'll get my sleeve back .
and to make sure nothing goes up or down my sleeve i 'm just going to squeeze my wrist right here .
and the object of this is quite simple .
i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully , if all is well , my pure animal magnetism will hold the knife .
in fact it 's held so tightly in place that i can shake it , and the knife does not come off .
ta da !
probably many of you in the room know this trick .
what happens is this .
i hold the knife in my hand .
the reason i 'm holding onto my wrist is because that 's actually the secret of the illusion .
in a moment when my hand moves from facing you to being away from you , this finger right here , my index finger is just going to shift from where it is , to a position pointing out like this .
nice one .
someone who didn 't have a childhood is out there .
so , it goes like this , from here , right .
and as i move around my finger shifts .
and we could talk about why this is deceptive , why you don 't notice there are only three fingers down here , because the mind , and the way it processes information , it doesn 't count , one , two , three . it groups them .
but that 's not really what this is about . right ? and then i open my hand up .
i take this hand away . you give the knife out .
there is a trick you can do for your friends and neighbors . thanks .
now , what does that have to do with the placebo effect ?
i read a study a year or so ago that really blew my mind wide open .
i 'm not a doctor or a researcher , so this , to me , was an astonishing thing .
but if you change the form that you give the placebo in , like you make a smaller pill , and color it blue , and stamp a letter into it , it is actually measurably more effective .
even though neither one of these things has any pharmaceutical they 're sugar pills .
but a white pill is not as good as a blue pill .
what ? that really flipped me out .
turns out though , that that 's not even where it stops .
if you have capsules , they 're more effective than tablets in any form .
a colored capsule , that 's yellow on one end and red on the other is better than a white capsule .
dosage has something to do with this .
one pill twice a day is not as good at three pills i don 't remember the statistic now . sorry .
but the point is . . .
and the form has something to do with it .
and if you want the ultimate in placebo , you 've go to the needle .
right ? a syringe with some inert a couple ccs of some inert something , and you inject this into a patient . . .
well this is such a powerful image in their mind , it 's so much stronger than the white pill .
it 's a really , this graph , well i 'll show it to you some other time when we have slides .
the point is the white pill is not as good as the blue pill is not as good as the capsule is not as good as the needle .
and none of it has any real pharmaceutical quality , it 's only your belief that makes it real in your body and makes a stronger effect .
i wanted to see if i could take that idea and apply it to a magic trick .
and take something that is obviously a fake trick and make it seem real .
and we know from that study that when you want reality , you go to the needle .
that 's my skin right there . this is not a hollywood special effect .
i 'm going to pierce my skin and run this needle through to the other side .
if you 're queasy if you faint easily i was doing this for some friends in the hotel room last night , and some people that i didn 't know , and one woman almost passed out .
so , i suggest if you get queasy easy that you look away for about the next in fact , you know what , i 'll do the first bad part behind it .
you 'll get to see , you can look away too if you 'd like to .
so , here is what happens , right here , the beginning of my flesh at the lower part of my arm i just make a little pierce .
i 'm sorry , man . am i freaking you out ?
ok , and then just through my skin a tiny bit , and then out the other side like this .
sort of .
but you can 't count my fingers right now can you ?
so , let me show them to you . that 's one , two three , four , five .
yes , well . . .
i know what people think when they see this .
so , let me give you a little peek .
how 's that look out there ? pretty good .
yeah , i know .
and the people in the back go , ok , i didn 't really see that . 
let me give you good close look at this .
that really is my skin . that is not a hollywood special effect .
that 's my flesh , and i can twist that around .
i 'm sorry . if you 're getting queasy , look away , don 't look at the thing .
people in the back or people on video years from now watching this will go , well yeah , that looks kind of neat in some sort of effect there , but if it were real he would be see there 's a hole there and a hole there , if it were real he would be bleeding .
yes , there it is .
normally now , i would take the needle out .
i would clean off my arm , and i would show you that there are no wounds .
but i think in this context and with the idea of taking something fake and making it into something real , i 'm just going to leave it there , and walk off the stage .
i will be seeing you several times over the next few days .
i hope you 're looking forward to that . thank you very much .
everybody talks about happiness these days .
i had somebody count the number of books with happiness in the title published in the last five years and they gave up after about , and there were many more .
there is a huge wave of interest in happiness , among researchers .
there is a lot of happiness coaching .
everybody would like to make people happier .
but in spite of all this flood of work , there are several cognitive traps that sort of make it almost impossible to think straight about happiness .
and my talk today will be mostly about these cognitive traps .
it turns out that the word happiness is just not a useful word anymore , because we apply it to too many different things .
i think there is one particular meaning to which we might restrict it , but by and large , this is something that we 'll have to give up and we 'll have to adopt the more complicated view of what well being is .
the second trap is a confusion between experience and memory basically , it 's between being happy in your life , and being happy about your life or happy with your life .
and those are two very different concepts , and they 're both lumped in the notion of happiness .
and the third is the focusing illusion , and it 's the unfortunate fact that we can 't think about any circumstance that affects well being without distorting its importance .
i mean , this is a real cognitive trap .
there 's just no way of getting it right .
and then he added , really quite emotionally , it ruined the whole experience .
but it hadn 't .
what it had ruined were the memories of the experience .
he had had the experience .
he had had minutes of glorious music .
what this is telling us , really , is that we might be thinking of ourselves and of other people in terms of two selves .
or how was your trip to albania ? or something like that .
and that really starts with a basic response of our memories it starts immediately .
we don 't only tell stories when we set out to tell stories .
our memory tells us stories , that is , what we get to keep from our experiences is a story .
this is an old study .
those are actual patients undergoing a painful procedure .
i won 't go into detail . it 's no longer painful these days , but it was painful when this study was run in the s .
they were asked to report on their pain every seconds .
here are two patients , those are their recordings .
and you are asked , who of them suffered more ? 
and it 's a very easy question .
but now there is another question how much did these patients think they suffered ? 
and here is a surprise .
and neither of these stories is very inspiring or great but one of them is this distinct . . .
but one of them is distinctly worse than the other .
and the one that is worse is the one where pain was at its peak at the very end it 's a bad story .
how do we know that ?
that will cause the patient to suffer , but just a little and much less than before .
what defines a story ?
and that is true of the stories that memory delivers for us , and it 's also true of the stories that we make up .
what defines a story are changes , significant moments and endings .
endings are very , very important and , in this case , the ending dominated .
it has moments of experience , one after the other .
and you can ask what happens to these moments ?
and the answer is really straightforward they are lost forever .
i mean , most of the moments of our life and i calculated , you know , the psychological present is said to be about three seconds long that means that , you know , in a life there are about million of them in a month , there are about , most of them don 't leave a trace .
and yet , somehow you get the sense that they should count , that what happens during these moments of experience is our life .
it 's the finite resource that we 're spending while we 're on this earth .
the biggest difference between them is in the handling of time .
you have not changed the story .
we actually don 't choose between experiences , we choose between memories of experiences .
and even when we think about the future , we don 't think of our future normally as experiences .
and this is a bit hard to justify i think .
i mean , how much do we consume our memories ?
and when i think about that , i think about a vacation we had in antarctica a few years ago , which was clearly the best vacation i 've ever had , and i think of it relatively often , relative to how much i think of other vacations .
now , if i had ever opened the folder with the pictures in it , i would have spent another hour .
now , that is three weeks , and that is at most an hour and a half .
there seems to be a discrepancy .
now , i may be a bit extreme , you know , in how little appetite i have for consuming memories , but even if you do more of this , there is a genuine question why do we put so much weight on memory relative to the weight that we put on experiences ?
so i want you to think about a thought experiment .
now , would you choose the same vacation ?
why do we pick the vacations we do is a problem that confronts us with a choice between the two selves .
now , the two selves bring up two notions of happiness .
there are really two concepts of happiness that we can apply , one per self .
and they 're all happiness for moments is a fairly complicated process .
what are the emotions that can be measured ?
this is not about how happily a person lives .
it is about how satisfied or pleased the person is when that person thinks about her life .
very different notion .
anyone who doesn 't distinguish those notions is going to mess up the study of happiness , and i belong to a crowd of students of well being , who 've been messing up the study of happiness for a long time in precisely this way .
the gallup organization has a world poll where more than half a million people have been asked questions about what they think of their life and about their experiences , and there have been other efforts along those lines .
so in recent years , we have begun to learn about the happiness of the two selves .
and the main lesson i think that we have learned is they are really different .
you can know how satisfied somebody is with their life , and that really doesn 't teach you much about how happily they 're living their life , and vice versa .
just to give you a sense of the correlation , the correlation is about . .
what that means is if you met somebody , and you were told , oh his father is six feet tall , how much would you know about his height ?
well , you would know something about his height , but there 's a lot of uncertainty .
you have that much uncertainty .
so the correlation is low .
we know something about what controls satisfaction of the happiness self .
we know that money is very important , goals are very important .
we know that happiness is mainly being satisfied with people that we like , spending time with people that we like .
there are other pleasures , but this is dominant .
so if you want to maximize the happiness of the two selves , you are going to end up doing very different things .
the bottom line of what i 've said here is that we really should not think of happiness as a substitute for well being .
it is a completely different notion .
now , very quickly , another reason we cannot think straight about happiness is that we do not attend to the same things when we think about life , and we actually live .
so , if you ask the simple question of how happy people are in california , you are not going to get to the correct answer .
when you ask that question , you think people must be happier in california if , say , you live in ohio .
and what happens is when you think about living in california , you are thinking of the contrast between california and other places , and that contrast , say , is in climate .
but now , because the reflective self is in charge , you may end up some people may end up moving to california .
and it 's sort of interesting to trace what is going to happen to people who move to california in the hope of getting happier .
we know that .
but one thing will happen they will think they are happier , because , when they think about it , they 'll be reminded of how horrible the weather was in ohio , and they will feel they made the right decision .
it is very difficult to think straight about well being , and i hope i have given you a sense of how difficult it is .
thank you .
thank you . i 've got a question for you .
thank you so much .
now , when we were on the phone a few weeks ago , you mentioned to me that there was quite an interesting result came out of that gallup survey .
is that something you can share since you do have a few moments left now ?
daniel kahneman sure .
i think the most interesting result that we found in the gallup survey is a number , which we absolutely did not expect to find .
when we looked at how feelings , vary with income .
and it turns out that , below an income of , dollars a year , for americans and that 's a very large sample of americans , like , , so it 's a large representative sample below an income of , dollars a year . . .
 , .
dk , .
above that , we get an absolutely flat line .
i mean i 've rarely seen lines so flat .
clearly , what is happening is money does not buy you experiential happiness , but lack of money certainly buys you misery , and we can measure that misery very , very clearly .
the more money you earn , the more satisfied you are .
that does not hold for emotions .
but danny , the whole american endeavor is about life , liberty , the pursuit of happiness .
if people took seriously that finding , i mean , it seems to turn upside down everything we believe about , like for example , taxation policy and so forth .
is there any chance that politicians , that the country generally , would take a finding like that seriously and run public policy based on it ?
the recognition is going to be slow in the united states , no question about that , but in the u .k . , it is happening , and in other countries it is happening .
people are recognizing that they ought to be thinking of happiness when they think of public policy .
it 's going to take a while , and people are going to debate whether they want to study experience happiness , or whether they want to study life evaluation , so we need to have that debate fairly soon .
this is going to influence policy , i think , in years to come .
this is going to be , i think , within the next decade or two , part of national statistics .
well , it seems to me that this issue will or at least should be the most interesting policy discussion to track over the next few years .
thank you so much for inventing behavioral economics .
thank you , danny kahneman .
i 'm jane mcgonigal . i 'm a game designer .
i 've been making games online now for years , and my goal for the next decade is to try to make it as easy to save the world in real life as it is to save the world in online games .
right now we spend three billion hours a week playing online games .
some of you might be thinking , that 's a lot of time to spend playing games .
maybe too much time , considering how many urgent problems we have to solve in the real world . 
but actually , according to my research at the institute for the future , it 's actually the opposite is true .
three billion hours a week is not nearly enough game play to solve the world 's most urgent problems .
in fact , i believe that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to increase that total dramatically .
i 've calculated the total we need at billion hours of game play every week .
so , that 's probably a bit of a counterintuitive idea , so i 'll say it again , let it sink in if we want to solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , global conflict , obesity , i believe that we need to aspire to play games online for at least billion hours a week , by the end of the next decade .
no . i 'm serious . i am .
here 's why . this picture pretty much sums up why i think games are so essential to the future survival of the human species . truly .
he wanted to capture the emotion of gaming , so he set up a camera in front of gamers while they were playing .
and this is a classic gaming emotion .
now , if you 're not a gamer , you might miss some of the nuance in this photo .
you probably see the sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but intense concentration , deep , deep focus on tackling a really difficult problem .
this is a gamer who is on the verge of something called an epic win .
oh , you 've heard of that . ok , good , so we have some gamers among us .
an epic win is an outcome that is so extraordinarily positive you had no idea it was even possible until you achieved it .
it was almost beyond the threshold of imagination .
and when you get there you are shocked to discover what you are truly capable of . that is an epic win .
this is a gamer on the verge of an epic win .
and this is the face that we need to see on millions of problem solvers all over the world as we try to tackle the obstacles of the next century the face of someone who , against all odds is on the verge of an epic win .
now , unfortunately this is more of the face that we see in everyday life now as we try to tackle urgent problems .
this is what i call the i 'm not good at life face , and this is actually me making it . can you see ? yes . good .
this is actually me making the i 'm not good at life face .
this is a piece of graffiti in my old neighborhood in berkeley , california , where i did my phd on why we 're better in games than we are in real life .
and this is a problem that a lot of gamers have .
we feel that we are not as good in reality as we are in games .
and i don 't mean just good as in successful , although that 's part of it .
and in real life , when we face failure , when we confront obstacles , we often don 't feel that way .
we feel overcome , we feel overwhelmed , we feel anxious , maybe depressed , frustrated or cynical .
we never have those feelings when we 're playing games , they just don 't exist in games .
so , that 's what i wanted to study when i was a graduate student .
what about games makes it impossible to feel that we can 't achieve everything ?
how can we take those feelings from games and apply them to real world work ?
so , i looked at games like world of warcraft , which is really the ideal collaborative problem solving environment .
and i started to notice a few things that make epic wins so possible in online worlds .
but not just any mission , it 's a mission that is perfectly matched with your current level in the game . right ?
so , you can do it .
they never give you a challenge that you can 't achieve .
but it is on the verge of what you 're capable of . so , you have to try hard , but there 's no unemployment in world of warcraft .
there is no sitting around wringing your hands , there 's always something specific and important to be done .
and there are also tons of collaborators .
everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people ready to work with you to achieve your epic mission .
and also there is this epic story , this inspiring story of why we 're there , and what we 're doing .
and then we get all this positive feedback .
you guys have heard of leveling up and plus one strength , and plus one intelligence .
we don 't get that kind of constant feedback in real life .
when i get off this stage i 'm not going to have plus one speaking , and plus one crazy idea , plus crazy idea .
i don 't get that feedback in real life .
it 's just better than reality .
now , that 's not necessarily a bad thing .
it might sound like it 's a bad thing .
that was the first upright primate .
okay , so when we talk about how much time we 're currently investing in playing games , the only way it makes sense to even think about it is to talk about time at the magnitude of human evolution , which is an extraordinary thing .
but it 's also apt . because it turns out that by spending all this time playing games , we 're actually changing what we are capable of as human beings .
we are evolving to be a more collaborative and hearty species .
this is true . i believe this .
now , hours is a really interesting number for two reasons .
first of all , for children in the united states , hours is the exact amount of time you will spend in school from fifth grade to high school graduation if you have perfect attendance .
so , you would have heard of his theory of success , the , hour theory of success .
we will be as good at whatever we do as the greatest people in the world .
and so , now what we 're looking at is an entire generation of young people who are virtuoso gamers .
so , the big question is , what exactly are gamers getting so good at ? 
this is how many people we now have in the world who spend at least an hour a day playing online games .
these are our virtuoso gamers , million people who are extraordinarily good at something .
and in the next decade we 're going to have another billion gamers who are extraordinarily good at whatever that is .
if you don 't know it already , this is coming .
they expect one billion more gamers in the next decade .
it will bring us up to . billion gamers .
so , i 've started to think about what these games are making us virtuosos at .
gamers always believe that an epic win is possible , and that it is always worth trying , and trying now .
gamers don 't sit around .
gamers are virtuosos at weaving a tight social fabric .
there 's a lot of interesting research that shows that we like people better after we play a game with them , even if they 've beaten us badly .
and the reason is , it takes a lot of trust to play a game with someone .
we trust that they will spend their time with us , that they will play by the same rules , value the same goal , they 'll stay with the game until it 's over .
and so , playing a game together actually builds up bonds and trust and cooperation .
and we actually build stronger social relationships as a result .
you know there 's a reason why the average world of warcraft gamer plays for hours a week , kind of a half time job .
it 's because we know , when we 're playing a game , that we 're actually happier working hard than we are relaxing , or hanging out .
we know that we are optimized , as human beings , to do hard meaningful work .
and gamers are willing to work hard all the time , if they 're given the right work .
finally epic meaning .
so , just one bit of trivia that helps put that into perspective so , you all know wikipedia , biggest wiki in the world .
second biggest wiki in the world , with nearly , articles , is the world of warcraft wiki .
five million people use it every month .
they have compiled more information about world of warcraft on the internet than any other topic covered on any other wiki in the world .
they are building an epic story .
they are building an epic knowledge resource about the world of warcraft .
okay , so these are four superpowers that add up to one thing gamers are super empowered , hopeful individuals .
these are people who believe that they are individually capable of changing the world .
and the only problem is that they believe that they are capable of changing virtual worlds and not the real world .
that 's the problem that i 'm trying to solve .
his work is brilliant . he looks at why people are investing so much time and energy and money in online worlds .
and he 's an economist . so , he 's rational .
and he says . . .
but he says that this makes perfect sense , because gamers can achieve more in online worlds than they can in real life .
they can have stronger social relationships in games than they can have in real life they get better feedback and feel more rewarded in games than they do in real life .
so , he says for now it makes perfect sense for gamers to spend more time in virtual worlds than the real world .
now , i also agree that that is rational , for now .
we have to start making the real world more like a game .
so , i take my inspiration from something that happened , years ago .
people were suffering . people were fighting .
it was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
and then on the next day , they would play games and on the next day , they would eat .
now , this is exactly , i think , how we 're using games today .
we 're using games to escape real world suffering .
we 're using games to get away from everything that 's broken in the real environment , everything that 's not satisfying about real life , and we 're getting what we need from games .
but it doesn 't have to end there .
this is really exciting .
they divided the entire kingdom in half .
they played one dice game , and the winners of that game got to go on an epic adventure .
now , this sounds crazy , right ?
and geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that lasted for nearly years that could have explained the famine .
so , this crazy story might be true .
they might have actually saved their culture by playing games , escaping to games for years , and then been so inspired , and knew so much about how to come together with games , that they actually saved the entire civilization that way .
okay , we can do that .
we 've been playing warcraft since .
i say we are ready for our own epic game .
let 's get half of us to agree to spend an hour a day playing games , until we solve real world problems .
now , i know you 're asking , how are we going to solve real world problems in games ? well , that 's what i have devoted my work to over the past few years , at the institute for the future .
we have this banner in our offices in palo alto , and it expresses our view of how we should try to relate to the future .
we do not want to try to predict the future .
what we want to do is make the future .
we want to imagine the best case scenario outcome , and then we want to empower people to make that outcome a reality .
we want to imagine epic wins , and then give people the means to achieve the epic win .
i 'm just going to very briefly show you three games that i 've made that are an attempt to give people the means to create epic wins in their own futures .
so , this is world without oil .
we made this game in .
we piloted this game with , players in , and we 've tracked them for the three years since .
and i can tell you that this is a transformative experience .
nobody wants to change how they live just because it 's good for the world , or because we 're supposed to .
but if you immerse them in an epic adventure and tell them , we 've run out of oil .
this is an amazing story and adventure for you to go on .
challenge yourself to see how you would survive , most of our players have kept up the habits that they learned in this game .
and the premise was a supercomputer has calculated that humans have only years left on the planet .
but in our game , instead of just having five people on the dream team , we said , everybody 's on the dream team , and it 's your job to invent the future of energy , the future of food , the future of health , the future of security and the future of the social safety net . 
we had , people play that game for eight weeks .
so , finally , the last game , we 're launching it march rd . this is a game done with the world bank institute .
working with universities all over sub saharan africa , and we are inviting them to learn social innovation skills .
so , i 'm going to wrap up now .
i want to ask a question .
what do you think happens next ?
we 've got all these amazing gamers , we 've got these games that are kind of pilots of what we might do , but none of them have saved the real world yet .
well i hope that you will agree with me that gamers are a human resource that we can use to do real world work , that games are a powerful platform for change .
i really hope that we can come together to play games that matter , to survive on this planet for another century .
and that 's my hope , that you will join me in making and playing games like this .
so , i say let the world changing games begin .
thank you .
let me read you the entry .
but , in fact , the print date was the early s , when i would have been starting primary school and forming an understanding of myself outside the family unit and as related to the other kids and the world around me .
i mean , from this entry , it would seem that i was born into a world that perceived someone like me to have nothing positive whatsoever going for them , when in fact , today i 'm celebrated for the opportunities and adventures my life has procured .
unfortunately , it 's not much better .
so , it 's not just about the words .
it 's what we believe about people when we name them with these words .
it 's about the values behind the words , and how we construct those values .
our language affects our thinking and how we view the world and how we view other people .
so , what reality do we want to call into existence a person who is limited , or a person who 's empowered ?
wouldn 't we want to open doors for them instead ?
and dr . p always wore really colorful bow ties and had the very perfect disposition to work with children .
i loved almost everything about my time spent at this hospital , with the exception of my physical therapy sessions .
and , one day , he came in to my session exhaustive and unforgiving , these sessions and he said to me , wow . aimee , you are such a strong and powerful little girl , i think you 're going to break one of those bands .
when you do break it , i 'm going to give you a hundred bucks . 
this is an example of how adults in positions of power can ignite the power of a child .
our language hasn 't caught up with the changes in our society , many of which have been brought about by technology .
but , in fact , we are changed . we are marked , of course , by a challenge , whether physically , emotionally or both .
and i 'm going to suggest that this is a good thing .
it 's part of our life .
and i tend to think of it like my shadow .
sometimes i see a lot of it , sometimes there 's very little , but it 's always with me .
and we do a disservice to our kids when we make them feel that they 're not equipped to adapt .
there 's an important difference and distinction between the objective medical fact of my being an amputee and the subjective societal opinion of whether or not i 'm disabled .
and , truthfully , the only real and consistent disability i 've had to confront is the world ever thinking that i could be described by those definitions .
in our desire to protect those we care about by giving them the cold , hard truth about their medical prognosis , or , indeed , a prognosis on the expected quality of their life , we have to make sure that we don 't put the first brick in a wall that will actually disable someone .
perhaps the existing model of only looking at what is broken in you and how do we fix it , serves to be more disabling to the individual than the pathology itself .
by not treating the wholeness of a person , by not acknowledging their potency , we are creating another ill on top of whatever natural struggle they might have .
we are effectively grading someone 's worth to our community .
and , most importantly , there 's a partnership between those perceived deficiencies and our greatest creative ability .
so it 's not about devaluing , or negating , these more trying times as something we want to avoid or sweep under the rug , but instead to find those opportunities wrapped in the adversity .
so maybe the idea i want to put out there is not so much overcoming adversity as it is opening ourselves up to it , embracing it , grappling with it , to use a wrestling term , maybe even dancing with it .
this year we celebrate the th birthday of charles darwin , and it was years ago , when writing about evolution , that darwin illustrated , i think , a truth about the human character .
conflict is the genesis of creation .
from darwin 's work , amongst others , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and flourish is driven by the struggle of the human spirit through conflict into transformation .
so , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest human skill .
and , perhaps , until we 're tested , we don 't know what we 're made of .
maybe that 's what adversity gives us a sense of self , a sense of our own power .
so , we can give ourselves a gift .
we can re imagine adversity as something more than just tough times .
maybe we can see it as change .
adversity is just change that we haven 't adapted ourselves to yet .
i think the greatest adversity that we 've created for ourselves is this idea of normalcy .
now , who 's normal ?
there 's no normal .
there 's common , there 's typical . there 's no normal , and would you want to meet that poor , beige person if they existed ?
i don 't think so .
if we can change this paradigm from one of achieving normalcy to one of possibility or potency , to be even a little bit more dangerous we can release the power of so many more children , and invite them to engage their rare and valuable abilities with the community .
there 's evidence that neanderthals , , years ago , carried their elderly and those with serious physical injury , and perhaps it 's because the life experience of survival of these people proved of value to the community .
they didn 't view these people as broken and useless they were seen as rare and valuable .
it was summertime i had shorts on .
i hear this guy , his voice behind me say , well , if it isn 't aimee mullins . 
and i turn around , and it 's this older man . i have no idea who he is .
and i said , i 'm sorry , sir , have we met ? i don 't remember meeting you . 
he said , well , you wouldn 't remember meeting me .
i mean , when we met i was delivering you from your mother 's womb . 
oh , that guy .
and , but of course , actually , it did click .
this man was dr . kean , a man that i had only known about through my mother 's stories of that day , because , of course , typical fashion , i arrived late for my birthday by two weeks .
and so my mother 's prenatal physician had gone on vacation , so the man who delivered me was a complete stranger to my parents .
he said to me , i had to give this prognosis to your parents that you would never walk , and you would never have the kind of mobility that other kids have or any kind of life of independence , and you 've been making liar out of me ever since . 
and he called this part of the course the x factor , the potential of the human will .
no prognosis can account for how powerful this could be as a determinant in the quality of someone 's life .
and dr . kean went on to tell me , he said , in my experience , unless repeatedly told otherwise , and even if given a modicum of support , if left to their own devices , a child will achieve . 
see , dr . kean made that shift in thinking .
he understood that there 's a difference between the medical condition and what someone might do with it .
and there 's been a shift in my thinking over time , in that , if you had asked me at years old , if i would have traded prosthetics for flesh and bone legs , i wouldn 't have hesitated for a second .
i aspired to that kind of normalcy back then .
but if you ask me today , i 'm not so sure .
and it 's because of the experiences i 've had with them , not in spite of the experiences i 've had with them .
and perhaps this shift in me has happened because i 've been exposed to more people who have opened doors for me than those who have put lids and cast shadows on me .
see , all you really need is one person to show you the epiphany of your own power , and you 're off .
if you can hand somebody the key to their own power the human spirit is so receptive if you can do that and open a door for someone at a crucial moment , you are educating them in the best sense .
you 're teaching them to open doors for themselves .
so again , which potential do we want to bring out ?
it 's called the streaming trials . we call it tracking here in the states .
it 's separating students from a , b , c , d and so on .
and the a students get the tougher curriculum , the best teachers , etc .
well , they took , over a three month period , d level students , gave them a 's , told them they were a 's , told them they were bright , and at the end of this three month period , they were performing at a level .
and , of course , the heartbreaking , flip side of this study , is that they took the a students and told them they were d 's . 
and that 's what happened at the end of that three month period .
those who were still around in school , besides the people who had dropped out .
a crucial part of this case study was that the teachers were duped too .
the teachers didn 't know a switch had been made .
they were simply told , these are the 'a students , ' these are the 'd students . ' and that 's how they went about teaching them and treating them .
so , i think that the only true disability is a crushed spirit , a spirit that 's been crushed doesn 't have hope , it doesn 't see beauty , it no longer has our natural , childlike curiosity and our innate ability to imagine .
come , dance with me . come , dance with me . ' thank you .
how would you like to be better than you are ?
suppose i said that , with just a few changes in your genes , you could get a better memory more precise , more accurate and quicker .
or maybe you 'd like to be more fit , stronger , with more stamina .
would you like to be more attractive and self confident ?
how about living longer with good health ?
which one would you like the most ?
which would you like , if you could have just one ?
creativity .
how many people would choose creativity ?
raise your hands . let me see .
a few . probably about as many as there are creative people here .
that 's very good .
how many would opt for memory ?
quite a few more .
how about fitness ?
a few less .
what about longevity ?
if you could have any one of these , it would be a very different world .
is it just imaginary ?
or , is it , perhaps , possible ?
evolution has been a perennial topic here at the ted conference , but i want to give you today one doctor 's take on the subject .
but if you do accept biological evolution , consider this is it just about the past , or is it about the future ?
does it apply to others , or does it apply to us ?
this is another look at the tree of life .
in this picture , i 've put a bush with a center branching out in all directions , because if you look at the edges of the tree of life , every existing species at the tips of those branches has succeeded in evolutionary terms it has survived it has demonstrated a fitness to its environment .
we branch off of a common ancestor to modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago .
in the interval , there have been perhaps or different species of hominids .
some have come and gone .
we have been here for about , years .
it may seem like we 're quite remote from other parts of this tree of life , but actually , for the most part , the basic machinery of our cells is pretty much the same .
and speaking of bacteria , do you realize that each of us carries in our gut more bacteria than there are cells in the rest of our body ?
maybe times more .
i mean think of it , when antonio damasio asks about your self image , do you think about the bacteria ?
it 's warm , it 's dark , it 's moist , it 's very cozy .
and you 're going to provide all the nutrition that they could possibly want with no effort on their part .
but otherwise , you are a wonderful environment for those bacteria , just as they are essential to your life .
they help in the digestion of essential nutrients , and they protect you against certain diseases .
but what will come in the future ?
are we at some kind of evolutionary equipoise as a species ?
or , are we destined to become something different something , perhaps , even better adapted to the environment ?
that was us .
i was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology .
sexual reproduction enters the picture .
in fact , you could say that the inevitability of the death of our bodies enters in evolutionary time at the same moment as sexual reproduction .
now i have to confess , when i was a college undergraduate , i thought , okay , sex death , sex death , death for sex it seemed pretty reasonable at the time , but with each passing year , i 've come to have increasing doubts .
i 've come to understand the sentiments of george burns , who was performing still in las vegas well into his s .
he answers the door .
she looks at him and says , i 'm here for super sex . 
 that 's fine , says george , i 'll take the soup . 
i was trying to preserve the body .
i wanted to keep us healthy .
i wanted to restore health from disease .
i wanted us to live long and healthy lives .
evolution is all about passing on the genome to the next generation , adapting and surviving through generation after generation .
i think we would all understand the sentiment that woody allen expressed when he said , i don 't want to achieve immortality through my work .
i want to achieve it through not dying . 
evolution does not necessarily favor the longest lived .
it doesn 't necessarily favor the biggest or the strongest or the fastest , and not even the smartest .
evolution favors those creatures best adapted to their environment .
that is the sole test of survival and success .
so what does this mean , as we look back at what has happened in evolution , and as we think about the place again of humans in evolution , and particularly as we look ahead to the next phase , i would say that there are a number of possibilities .
the first is that we will not evolve .
we have reached a kind of equipoise .
a second possibility is that there will be evolution of the traditional kind , natural , imposed by the forces of nature .
and the argument here would be that the wheels of evolution grind slowly , but they are inexorable .
and as far as isolation goes , when we as a species do colonize distant planets , there will be the isolation and the environmental changes that could produce evolution in the natural way .
but there 's a third possibility , an enticing , intriguing and frightening possibility .
i call it neo evolution the new evolution that is not simply natural , but guided and chosen by us as individuals in the choices that we will make .
now how could this come about ?
how could it be possible that we would do this ?
consider , first , the reality that people today , in some cultures , are making choices about their offspring .
they 're , in some cultures , choosing to have more males than females .
it 's not necessarily good for the society , but it 's what the individual and the family are choosing .
think also , if it were possible ever for you to choose , not simply to choose the sex of your child , but for you in your body to make the genetic adjustments that would cure or prevent diseases .
what if you could make the genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or alzheimer 's or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminate stroke ?
wouldn 't you want to make those changes in your genes ?
the human genome project started in , and it took years .
it cost . billion dollars .
the year after it was finished in , you could do the same job for million dollars in three to four months .
today , you can have a complete sequence of the three billion base pairs in the human genome at a cost of about , dollars and in the space of about a week .
it won 't be very long before the reality will be the , dollar human genome , and it will be increasingly available for everyone .
these changes are coming .
the same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that will not only protect you against themselves , but induce immunity against other viruses .
can you imagine something good coming out of tobacco ?
imagine then just two other little changes .
you can change the cells in your body , but what if you could change the cells in your offspring ?
who doesn 't want healthier children ?
and then , that same analytic technology , that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent disease , will also enable us to adopt super attributes , hyper capacities that better memory .
why not live longer ?
these will be irresistible .
and when we are at a position where we can pass it on to the next generation , and we can adopt the attributes we want , we will have converted old style evolution into neo evolution .
we 'll take a process that normally might require , years , and we can compress it down to a thousand years and maybe even in the next years .
these are choices that your grandchildren , or their grandchildren , are going to have before them .
will we use these choices to make a society that is better , that is more successful , that is kinder ?
or , will we selectively choose different attributes that we want for some of us and not for others of us ?
these are the kinds of questions that we will have to face .
and most profoundly of all , will we ever be able to develop the wisdom , and to inherit the wisdom , that we 'll need to make these choices wisely ?
for better or worse , and sooner than you may think , these choices will be up to us .
thank you .
i want you now to imagine a wearable robot that gives you superhuman abilities , or another one that takes wheelchair users up standing and walking again .
we at berkeley bionics call these robots exoskeletons .
these are nothing else than something that you put on in the morning , and it will give you extra strength , and it will further enhance your speed , and it will help you , for instance , to manage your balance .
it is actually the true integration of the man and the machine .
but not only that it will integrate and network you to the universe and other devices out there .
this is just not some blue sky thinking .
to show you now what we are working on by starting out talking about the american soldier , that on average does carry about lbs . on their backs , and they are being asked to carry more equipment .
so we thought we would look at this challenge and create an exoskeleton that would help deal with this issue .
its flexible design allows for deep squats , crawls and high agility movements .
it senses what i want to do , where i want to go , and then augments my strength and endurance .
so this is for real .
now let 's turn our heads towards the wheelchair users , something that i 'm particularly passionate about .
there are million people estimated to be in wheelchairs worldwide .
this is about one percent of the total population .
and that 's actually a conservative estimate .
we are talking here about , oftentimes , very young individuals with spinal cord injuries , that in the prime of their life s , s , s hit a wall and the wheelchair 's the only option .
but it is also the aging population that is multiplying in numbers .
and the only option , pretty much when it 's stroke or other complications is the wheelchair .
and that is actually for the last years , since its very successful introduction , i must say .
so we thought we would start writing a brand new chapter of mobility .
thank you .
amanda is wearing our elegs set .
it has sensors .
not long afterwards , a doctor strode into my hospital room , and he said , amanda , you 'll never walk again . 
but nothing has been invented that enables me to walk , until now .
thank you .
as you can see , we have the technology , we have the platforms to sit down and have discussions with you .
it 's in our hands , and we have all the potential here to change the lives of future generations not only for the soldiers , or for amanda here and all the wheelchair users , but for everyone .
thanks .
back in new york , i am the head of development for a non profit called robin hood .
i remember my first fire .
the dog ! i was stunned with jealousy .
well , i was next .
the captain waved me over .
he said , bezos , i need you to go into the house .
i need you to go upstairs , past the fire , and i need you to get this woman a pair of shoes . 
i swear .
so , not exactly what i was hoping for , but off i went up the stairs , down the hall , past the 'real ' firefighters , who were pretty much done putting out the fire at this point , into the master bedroom to get a pair of shoes .
now i know what you 're thinking , but i 'm no hero .
i carried my payload back downstairs where i met my nemesis and the precious dog by the front door .
the act of kindness she noted above all others someone had even gotten her a pair of shoes .
and you know what i 've learned ?
they all matter .
don 't wait until you make your first million to make a difference in somebody 's life .
if you have something to give , give it now .
serve food at a soup kitchen . clean up a neighborhood park .
be a mentor .
not every day is going to offer us a chance to save somebody 's life , but every day offers us an opportunity to affect one .
so get in the game . save the shoes .
thank you .
mark , mark , come back .
thank you .
ladies and gentlemen , meet your cousins .
this is the world of wild bonobos in the jungles of congo .
bonobos are , together with chimpanzees , your living closest relative .
that means we all share a common ancestor , an evolutionary grandmother , who lived around six million years ago .
now , chimpanzees are well known for their aggression .
but bonobos show us the other side of the coin .
these guys have really worked something out , since this leads to a highly tolerant society where fatal violence has not been observed yet .
but unfortunately , bonobos are the least understood of the great apes .
the congo is a paradox a land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty , but also the heart of darkness itself the scene of a violent conflict that has raged for decades and claimed nearly as many lives as the first world war .
yet , in this land of violence and chaos , you can hear hidden laughter swaying the trees .
who are these cousins ?
we know them as the make love , not war apes since they have frequent , promiscuous and bisexual sex to manage conflict and solve social issues .
bonobos , like humans , love to play throughout their entire lives .
for us and them , play is foundational for bonding relationships and fostering tolerance .
it 's where we learn to trust and where we learn about the rules of the game .
play increases creativity and resilience , and it 's all about the generation of diversity diversity of interactions , diversity of behaviors , diversity of connections .
and when you watch bonobo play , you 're seeing the very evolutionary roots of human laughter , dance and ritual .
now , i don 't know how you play , but i want to show you a couple of unique clips fresh from the wild .
first , it 's a ball game bonobo style and i do not mean football .
have a look what she 's doing .
it might be the evolutionary origin of the phrase , she 's got him by the balls . 
only i think that he 's rather loving it here , right ?
yeah .
i think , like her , we sometimes play alone , and we explore the boundaries of our inner and our outer worlds .
and it 's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore , drives us to interact , and then the unexpected connections we form are the real hotbed for creativity .
the secret is that play is the key to these capacities .
play is not frivolous .
play 's essential .
for bonobos and humans alike , life is not just red in tooth and claw .
thank you .
i want you to imagine two couples in the middle of on the exact same day , at the exact same moment , each conceiving a baby okay ?
so two couples each conceiving one baby .
now i don 't want you to spend too much time imagining the conception , because if you spend all that time imagining that conception , you 're not going to listen to me .
so just imagine that for a moment .
and in the other case , the sperm is carrying an x chromosome , meeting the x chromosome of the egg .
both are viable both take off .
we 'll come back to these people later .
so i wear two hats in most of what i do .
as the one hat , i do history of anatomy .
in that case , what i 've worked with is people who have body types that challenge social norms .
but because this individual lacks receptors to hear that testosterone , the body doesn 't react to the testosterone .
so lots of levels of testosterone , but no reaction to it .
as a consequence , the body develops more along the female typical path .
when the child is born , she looks like a girl .
she is a girl . she is raised as a girl .
and it 's often not until she hits puberty and she 's growing and developing breasts , but she 's not getting her period , that somebody figures out something 's up here .
and they do some tests and figure out that , instead of having ovaries inside and a uterus , she actually has testes inside , and she has a y chromosome .
now what 's important to understand is you may think of this person as really being male , but they 're really not .
they 're in the back of our body .
another example a few years ago i got a call from a man who was years old , who was born a boy , raised a boy , had a girlfriend , had sex with his girlfriend , had a life as a guy and had just found out that he had ovaries and a uterus inside .
and he was born looking like a boy nobody suspected anything .
and we 're not exactly sure why that happens .
so sex can come in lots of different varieties .
in many cases , people are actually perfectly healthy .
the reason they 're often subject to various kinds of surgeries is because they threaten our social categories .
or system has been based typically on the idea that a particular kind of anatomy comes with a particular identity .
so we have the concept that what it means to be a woman is to have a female identity what it means to be a black person is , allegedly , is to have an african anatomy in terms of your history .
and so we have this terribly simplistic idea .
so we have a lot of very romantic ideas in our culture about individualism .
and our nation 's really founded on a very romantic concept of individualism .
well you can imagine how startling then it is when you have children that are born who are two people inside of one body .
and i had to explain to the journalists there isn 't such a test .
and it 's not just in terms of sex .
it 's also in terms of race , which turns out to be vastly more complicated than our terminology has allowed .
as we look , we get into all sorts of uncomfortable areas .
we look , for example , about the fact that we share at least percent of our dna with chimpanzees .
what are we to make of the fact that we differ from them only really by a few nucleotides ?
so we 're seeing this in all sorts of places in human life .
one of the places we 're seeing it , for example , in our culture today , in the united states today , is battles over the beginning of life and the end of life .
we have very difficult conversations nowadays probably not out in the open as much as within medicine about the question of when somebody 's dead .
in the past , our ancestors never had to struggle so much with this question of when somebody was dead .
at most , they 'd stick a feather on somebody 's nose , and if it twitched , they didn 't bury them yet .
if it stopped twitching , you bury them .
but today , we have a situation where we want to take vital organs out of beings and give them to other beings .
and as a consequence , we 're stuck with having to struggle with this really difficult question about who 's dead , and this leads us to a really difficult situation where we don 't have such simple categories as we 've had before .
now you might think that all this breaking down of categories would make somebody like me really happy .
i 'm a political progressive , i defend people with unusual bodies , but i have to admit to you that it makes me nervous .
understanding that these categories are really much more unstable than we thought makes me tense .
and it makes me tense from the point of view of thinking about democracy .
so in order to tell you about that tension , i have to first admit to you that i 'm a huge fan of the founding fathers .
the founding fathers were , for my point of view , the original anatomical activists , and this is why .
so as you all recall , what our founding fathers were rejecting was a concept of monarchy , and the monarchy was basically based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy .
they had a concept of blue blood .
the founding fathers rejected that idea , and they replaced it with a new anatomical concept , and that concept was all men are created equal .
and that was democracy growing up , but it was also science growing up at the same time .
and if you look , for example , in the declaration of independence , they talk about nature and nature 's god .
they don 't talk about god and god 's nature .
they 're talking about the power of nature to tell us who we are .
so as part of that , they were coming to us with a concept that was about anatomical commonality .
and in doing so , they were really setting up in a beautiful way the civil rights movement of the future .
they didn 't think of it that way , but they did it for us , and it was great .
so what happened years afterward ?
what happened was women , for example , who wanted the right to vote , took the founding fathers ' concept of anatomical commonality being more important than anatomical difference and said , the fact that we have a uterus and ovaries is not significant enough in terms of a difference to mean that we shouldn 't have the right to vote , the right to full citizenship , the right to own property , etc . , etc . 
and women successfully argued that .
again , people of color appealing to a commonality of anatomy over a difference of anatomy , again , successfully .
the problem is , of course , that , as we begin to look at all that commonality , we have to begin to question why we maintain certain divisions .
now mind you , i want to maintain some divisions , anatomically , in our culture .
for example , i don 't want to give a fish the same rights as a human .
i don 't want to say we give up entirely on anatomy .
i don 't want to say five year olds should be allowed to consent to sex or consent to marry .
so there are some anatomical divisions that make sense to me and that i think we should retain .
but the challenge is trying to figure out which ones they are and why do we retain them and do they have meaning .
so let 's go back to those two beings conceived at the beginning of this talk .
we have two beings , both conceived in the middle of on the exact same day .
let 's imagine one of them , mary , is born three months prematurely , so she 's born on june , .
henry , by contrast , is born at term , so he 's born on march , .
we find other kinds of weirdness in terms of what their rights are .
henry , by virtue of being assumed to be male although i haven 't told you that he 's the xy one by virtue of being assumed to be male is now liable to be drafted , which mary does not need to worry about .
mary , meanwhile , cannot in all the states have the same right that henry has in all the states , namely , the right to marry .
henry can marry in every state a woman , but mary can only marry today in a few states a woman .
so we have these anatomical categories that persist that are in many ways problematic and questionable .
and the question to me becomes what do we do , as our science gets to be so good in looking at anatomy , that we reach the point where we have to admit that a democracy that 's been based on anatomy might start falling apart ?
i don 't want to give up the science , but at the same time it kind of feels sometimes like the science is coming out from under us .
so where do we go ?
it seems like what happens in our culture is a sort of pragmatic attitude well , we have to draw the line somewhere , so we will draw the line somewhere . 
but a lot of people get stuck in a very strange position .
so for example , texas has at one point decided that what it means to marry a man is to mean that you don 't have a y chromosome , and what it means to marry a woman means you do have a y chromosome .
now in practice they don 't actually test people for their chromosomes .
if we look at one of the founding fathers of modern democracy , dr . martin luther king , he offers us something of a solution in his i have a dream speech .
he says we should judge people based not on the color of their skin , but on the content of their character , moving beyond anatomy .
and i want to say , yeah , that sounds like a really good idea . 
but in practice , how do you do it ?
how do you judge people based on the content of character ?
i also want to point out that i 'm not sure that is how we should distribute rights in terms of humans , because , i have to admit , that there are some golden retrievers i know that are probably more deserving of social services than some humans i know .
it turns out to be really difficult .
do we really want to go there ?
i 'm not sure where we go .
what i do know is that it seems to be really important to think about the idea of the united states being in the lead of thinking about this issue of democracy .
we 've done a really good job struggling with democracy , and i think we would do a good job in the future .
we don 't have that kind of situation .
but when i was on the phone with him , asking why he was going to do this surgery this was a very high risk surgery his answer was that , in this other nation , these children were going to be treated very badly , and so he had to do this .
my response to him was , well , have you considered political asylum instead of a separation surgery ? 
the united states has offered tremendous possibility for allowing people to be the way they are , without having them have to be changed for the sake of the state .
so i think we have to be in the lead .
well , just to close , i want to suggest to you that i 've been talking a lot about the fathers .
and i want to think about the possibilities of what democracy might look like , or might have looked like , if we had more involved the mothers .
and one of the things that i 've been really interested in is looking at the differences between males and females in terms of the way they think and operate in the world .
and what we know from cross cultural studies is that females , on average not everyone , but on average are more inclined to be very attentive to complex social relations and to taking care of people who are basically vulnerable within the group .
and so if we think about that , we have an interesting situation on our hands .
years ago , when i was in graduate school , one of my graduate advisers who knew i was interested in feminism i considered myself a feminist , as i still do asked a really strange question .
he said , tell me what 's feminine about feminism . 
and i thought , well that 's the dumbest question i 've ever heard .
feminism is all about undoing stereotypes about gender , so there 's nothing feminine about feminism . 
but the more i thought about his question , the more i thought there might be something feminine about feminism .
and maybe that 's where we need to go in the future , when we take democracy beyond anatomy , is to think less about the individual body , in terms of the identity , and think more about those relationships .
so that as we the people try to create a more perfect union , we 're thinking about what we do for each other .
thank you .
but before i show you what i 've got inside , i 'm going to make a very public confession , and that is , i 'm outfit obsessed .
but i don 't buy anything new .
aww , thank you .
secondhand shopping allows me to reduce the impact my wardrobe has on the environment and on my wallet .
i mean , what am i going to find today ?
is it going to be my size ?
will i like the color ?
will it be under ?
if all the answers are yes , i feel as though i 've won .
i want to get back to my suitcase and tell you what i packed for this exciting week here at ted .
i mean , what does somebody with all these outfits bring with her ?
so i 'm going to show you exactly what i brought .
i brought seven pairs of underpants and that 's it .
i was betting that i 'd be able to find everything else i could possible want to wear once i got here to palm springs .
and since you don 't know me as the woman walking around ted in her underwear that means i found a few things .
and i 'd really love to show you my week 's worth of outfits right now .
does that sound good ?
so as i do this , i 'm also going to tell you a few of the life lessons that , believe it or not , i have picked up in these adventures wearing nothing new .
so let 's start with sunday .
i call this shiny tiger . 
you do not have to spend a lot of money to look great .
you can almost always look phenomenal for under .
this whole outfit , including the jacket , cost me , and it was the most expensive thing that i wore the entire week .
monday color is powerful .
if you are happy , you are going to attract other happy people to you .
tuesday fitting in is way overrated .
i 've spent a whole lot of my life trying to be myself and at the same time fit in .
just be who you are .
if you are surrounding yourself with the right people , they will not only get it , they will appreciate it .
wednesday embrace your inner child .
i like to smile and say , thank you . 
thursday confidence is key .
if you think you look good in something , you almost certainly do .
and if you don 't think you look good in something , you 're also probably right .
i grew up with a mom who taught me this day in and day out .
but it wasn 't until i turned that i really got what this meant .
and i 'm going to break it down for you for just a second .
if you believe you 're a beautiful person inside and out , there is no look that you can 't pull off .
so there is no excuse for any of us here in this audience .
we should be able to rock anything we want to rock .
thank you .
and finally , saturday developing your own unique personal style is a really great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word .
it 's been proven to me time and time again as people have walked up to me this week simply because of what i 'm wearing , and we 've had great conversations .
so obviously this is not all going to fit back in my tiny suitcase .
so before i go home to brooklyn , i 'm going to donate everything back .
because the lesson i 'm trying to learn myself this week is that it 's okay to let go .
thank you very much .
thank you .
good afternoon , everybody .
i 've got something to show you .
think about this as a pixel , a flying pixel .
let me tell you a bit about it .
now if you take this picture i 'm italian originally , and every boy in italy grows up with this picture on the wall of his bedroom but the reason i 'm showing you this is that something very interesting happened in formula racing over the past couple of decades .
now some time ago , if you wanted to win a formula race , you take a budget , and you bet your budget on a good driver and a good car .
and if the car and the driver were good enough , then you 'd win the race .
now today , if you want to win the race , actually you need also something like this something that monitors the car in real time , has a few thousand sensors collecting information from the car , transmitting this information into the system , and then processing it and using it in order to go back to the car with decisions and changing things in real time as information is collected .
our cities , over the past few years , just have been blanketed with networks , electronics .
they 're becoming like computers in open air .
and , as computers in open air , they 're starting to respond in a different way to be able to be sensed and to be actuated .
just as an aside , i wanted to mention , cities are only two percent of the earth 's crust , but they are percent of the world 's population .
so if we 're able to do something with cities , that 's a big deal .
beyond cities , all of this sensing and actuating is entering our everyday objects .
that 's from an exhibition that paola antonelli is organizing at moma later this year , during the summer .
it 's called talk to me . 
well our objects , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
in a certain sense , it 's almost as if every atom out there were becoming both a sensor and an actuator .
and that is radically changing the interaction we have as humans with the environment out there .
in a certain sense , it 's almost as if the old dream of michelangelo . . .
well today , for the first time , our environment is starting to talk back to us .
and i 'll show just a few examples again , with this idea of sensing our environment and actuating it .
let 's starting with sensing .
well , the first project i wanted to share with you is actually one of the first projects by our lab .
it was four and a half years ago in italy .
the summer was a lucky summer .
it 's when italy won the soccer world cup .
and anyway , italy won at the end .
now look at what happened that day just by monitoring activity happening on the network .
here you see the city .
it 's morning , before the match .
you see the timeline on the top .
early afternoon , people here and there , making calls and moving .
the match begins silence .
france scores . italy scores .
halftime , people make a quick call and go to the bathroom .
second half . end of normal time .
first overtime , second .
italy wins . yeah .
well , that night , everybody went to celebrate in the center .
you saw the big peak .
the following day , again everybody went to the center to meet the winning team and the prime minister at the time .
and then everybody moved down .
well , that 's just one example of how we can sense the city today in a way that we couldn 't have done just a few years ago .
another quick example about sensing it 's not about people , but about things we use and consume .
well today , we know everything about where our objects come from .
this is a map that shows you all the chips that form a mac computer , how they came together .
but we know very little about where things go .
so in this project , we actually developed some small tags to track trash as it moves through the system .
then we put a little chip , little tag , onto the trash and then started following it .
here are the results we just obtained .
from seattle . . .
after one week .
with this information we realized there 's a lot of inefficiencies in the system .
we can actually do the same thing with much less energy .
this data was not available before .
but the other thing is that we believe that if we see every day that the cup we 're throwing away , it doesn 't disappear , it 's still somewhere on the planet .
and the plastic bottle we 're throwing away every day still stays there .
and if we show that to people , then we can also promote some behavioral change .
so that was the reason for the project .
and the question was how could technology , new technology , be added to that ?
he liked it very much .
and we got a commission to design a building at the entrance of the expo .
the whole building is made of water .
there 's no doors or windows , but when you approach it , it will open up to let you in .
the roof also is covered with water .
and if there 's a bit of wind , if you want to minimize splashing , you can actually lower the roof .
or you could close the building , and the whole architecture will disappear , you know , these days , you always get images during the winter , when they take the roof down , of people who have been there and said , they demolished the building . 
no , they didn 't demolish it , just when it goes down , the architecture almost disappears .
here 's the building working .
you see the person puzzled about what was going on inside .
and here was myself trying not to get wet , testing the sensors that open the water .
well , i should tell you now what happened one night when all of the sensors stopped working .
but actually that night , it was even more fun .
not anymore a building that would open up to let you in , but a building that would still make cuts and holes through the water , and you had to jump without getting wet .
and that was , for us , was very interesting , because , as architects , as engineers , as designers , we always think about how people will use the things we design .
but then reality 's always unpredictable .
and that 's the beauty of doing things that are used and interact with people .
and this is what led us to think about the following project i 'll show you now .
imagine you could have small helicopters that move in the air , and then each of them with a small pixel in changing lights almost as a cloud that can move in space .
here is the video .
so imagine one helicopter , like the one we saw before , moving with others , in synchrony .
so you can have this cloud .
you can have a kind of flexible screen or display , like this a regular configuration in two dimensions .
you can play with a different type .
imagine your screen could just appear in different scales or sizes , different types of resolution .
when you turn on the light , actually you see this . so the same as we saw before .
and imagine each of them then controlled by people .
you can have each pixel having an input that comes from people , from people 's movement , or so and so .
i want to show you something here for the first time .
and here you can see roberto dancing .
so you can reconstruct a whole movement .
you can go all the way through .
i wanted to show you the last project we are working on .
it 's something we 're working on for the london olympics .
it 's called the cloud .
imagine you can have everybody make a small donation for one pixel .
and i think what is remarkable that has happened over the past couple of years is that , over the past couple of decades , we went from the physical world to the digital one .
this has been digitizing everything , knowledge , and making that accessible through the internet .
now today , for the first time and the obama campaign showed us this we can go from the digital world , from the self organizing power of networks , to the physical one .
this can be , in our case , we want to use it for designing and doing a symbol .
that means something built in a city .
but tomorrow it can be , in order to tackle today 's pressing challenges think about climate change or co emissions how we can go from the digital world to the physical one .
so the idea that we can actually involve people in doing this thing together , collectively .
you can move inside , have different types of experiences .
you can actually see from underneath , sharing the main moments for the olympics in and beyond , and really using it as a way to connect with the community .
so both the physical cloud in the sky and something you can go to the top of , like london 's new mountaintop .
you can enter inside it .
thank you .
as an artist , connection is very important to me .
through my work i 'm trying to articulate that humans are not separate from nature and that everything is interconnected .
i first went to antarctica almost years ago , where i saw my first icebergs .
i was in awe .
icebergs are born when they calve off of glaciers or break off of ice shelves .
each iceberg has its own individual personality .
they have a distinct way of interacting with their environment and their experiences .
some refuse to give up and hold on to the bitter end , while others can 't take it anymore and crumble in a fit of dramatic passion .
it 's easy to think , when you look at an iceberg , that they 're isolated , that they 're separate and alone , much like we as humans sometimes view ourselves .
but the reality is far from it .
as an iceberg melts , i am breathing in its ancient atmosphere .
i approach photographing these icebergs as if i 'm making portraits of my ancestors , knowing that in these individual moments they exist in that way and will never exist that way again .
and some of the ice is over , years old .
it 's a very rare occasion that you get to actually witness an iceberg rolling .
so here it is .
you can see on the left side a small boat .
that 's about a foot boat .
and i 'd like you to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and where it is at the waterline .
you can see here , it begins to roll , and the boat has moved to the other side , and the man is standing there .
it 's about feet above the water , or meters .
and this video is real time .
and just like that , the iceberg shows you a different side of its personality .
thank you .
i have had the distinct blessing in my life to have worked on a bunch of amazing projects .
but the coolest i ever worked on was around this guy .
and he came up home from a run one day and said , dad , my legs are tingling . 
and that was the onset of als .
he only has use of his eyes .
i was exposed to him .
i have a company that does design and animation , so obviously graffiti is definitely an intricate part of what we admire and respect in the art world .
so i went and met with his brother and father and said , we 're going to give you this money .
what are you going to do with it ? 
and his brother said , i just want to be able to talk to tony again .
i just want to be able to communicate with him and i said , wait a second , isn 't that i 've seen stephen hawking don 't all paralyzed people have the ability to communicate via these devices ? 
these devices aren 't accessible to people . 
and i said , well , how do you actually communicate ? 
that 's how they communicate so run their finger along .
i said , that 's archaic . how can that be ? 
so i showed up with the desire to just write a check , and instead , i wrote a check that i had no freaking idea how i was going to cash .
i committed to his brother and his father right then and there i 'm like , all right , here 's the deal tony 's going to speak , we 're going to get him a machine , and we 're going to figure out a way for him to do his art again .
because it 's a travesty that someone who still has all of that in him isn 't able to communicate it . 
so i spoke at a conference a couple months after that .
so they go around and do art installations like this .
all the things that go up there , they said there 's a life cycle .
but there was always a life cycle to their presentations .
so that started the journey .
and about two years later , about a year later , after a bunch of organization and a bunch of moving things around , we 'd accomplished a couple things .
which was awesome .
and he 's seriously one of the funniest i call him yoda , because you talk to the guy , you get an email from him , and you 're like , i 'm not worthy . this guy 's so amazing . 
the other thing we did is we flew seven programmers from all over the world literally every corner of the world into our house .
but for over two weeks , we programmed , we went to the venice boardwalk , my kids got involved , my dog got involved , and we created this .
we took a ps camera , hacked it open , mounted it to an led light , and now there 's a device that is free you build this yourself , we publish the code for free , you download the software for free .
and now we 've created a device that has absolutely no limitations .
there 's no hospital that can say no . 
anybody who 's paralyzed now has access to actually draw or communicate using only their eyes .
thank you .
thank you guys very much . that was awesome .
i love this picture , because this is someone else 's room and that 's his room .
so there 's all this hustle and bustle going on for the big unveiling .
and this is an amazing picture , because this is his life support system , and he 's looking over his life support system .
we kicked his bed so that he could see out .
so at the end of this , he sent us an email , and this is what the email said that was the first time i 've drawn anything for seven years .
i feel like i had been held underwater , and someone finally reached down and pulled my head up so i could breathe . 
isn 't that awesome ?
that 's what keeps us going and keeps us developing .
and we 've got such a long way to go with this .
this is an amazing device , but it 's the equivalent of an etch a sketch .
and someone who has that kind of artistic potential deserves so much more .
so we 're in the process of trying to figure out how to make it better , faster , stronger .
since that time , we 've had all kinds of acknowledgment .
we 've won a bunch of awards .
remember , it 's free none of us are making any money on this thing .
it 's all coming out of our own pockets .
so the awards were like , oh , this is fantastic . 
armstrong twittered about us , and then in december , time magazine honored us as one of the top inventions of , which was really cool .
so basically this is my point if you see something that 's not possible , make it possible .
make it possible , everyone in this room .
and this is the question i want everyone to ask yourself every single day when you come up with something you feel that needs to be done if not now , then when ? and if not me , then who ?
thank you guys .
and i always tell people that i don 't want to show up looking like a scientist .
i 'm here today to talk to you about circles and epiphanies .
and you know , an epiphany is usually something you find that you dropped someplace .
you 've just got to go around the block to see it as an epiphany .
that 's a painting of a circle .
it 's the kind of complicated circle that i 'm going to tell you about .
she saved my life by letting me go to the bathroom in the teachers ' lounge .
she did it in secret .
she did it for three years .
and i had to get out of town .
i had a thumb , i had dollars , and i ended up in san francisco , california met a lover and back in the ' s , found it necessary to begin work on aids organizations .
i 'm disappointed that we never got to know each other as adults .
could you please come to ohio , and please bring that man that i know you have found by now .
well , the next day we were in cleveland .
we took a look at her , we laughed , we cried , and we knew that she needed to be in a hospice .
we found her one , we got her there , and we took care of her and watched over her family , because it was necessary .
it 's something we knew how to do .
and just as the woman who wanted to know me as an adult got to know me , she turned into a box of ashes and was placed in my hands .
and what had happened was the circle had closed , it had become a circle and that epiphany i talked about presented itself .
the epiphany is that death is a part of life .
she saved my life i and my partner saved hers .
and you know , that part of life needs everything that the rest of life does .
it needs truth and beauty , and i 'm so happy it 's been mentioned so much here today .
it also needs it needs dignity , love and pleasure , and it 's our job to hand those things out .
thank you .
imagine a big explosion as you climb through , ft .
imagine a plane full of smoke .
imagine an engine going clack , clack , clack , clack , clack , clack , clack .
it sounds scary .
well i had a unique seat that day . i was sitting in d .
so i looked at them right away , and they said , no problem . we probably hit some birds . 
the pilot had already turned the plane around , and we weren 't that far .
you could see manhattan .
two minutes later , three things happened at the same time .
the pilot lines up the plane with the hudson river .
that 's usually not the route .
he turns off the engines .
i could see in her eyes , it was terror . life was over .
now i want to share with you three things i learned about myself that day .
i learned that it all changes in an instant .
as i thought about that later on , i came up with a saying , which is , i collect bad wines . 
because if the wine is ready and the person is there , i 'm opening it .
i no longer want to postpone anything in life .
and that urgency , that purpose , has really changed my life .
i 've lived a good life .
but in my humanity , i also allow my ego to get in .
and i thought about my relationship with my wife , with my friends , with people .
and after , as i reflected on that , i decided to eliminate negative energy from my life .
it 's not perfect , but it 's a lot better .
i 've not had a fight with my wife in two years .
it feels great .
i no longer try to be right i choose to be happy .
you can see the water coming .
i 'm saying , please blow up . 
i don 't want this thing to break in pieces like you 've seen in those documentaries .
and as we 're coming down , i had a sense of , wow , dying is not scary .
it 's almost like we 've been preparing for it our whole lives .
but it was very sad .
i didn 't want to go i love my life .
i only wish i could see my kids grow up .
about a month later , i was at a performance by my daughter first grader , not much artistic talent . . .
 . . . yet .
and it made all the sense in the world to me .
i realized at that point , by connecting those two dots , that the only thing that matters in my life is being a great dad .
above all , above all , the only goal i have in life is to be a good dad .
i was given the gift of a miracle , of not dying that day .
i was given another gift , which was to be able to see into the future and come back and live differently .
i challenge you guys that are flying today , imagine the same thing happens on your plane and please don 't but imagine , and how would you change ?
what would you get done that you 're waiting to get done because you think you 'll be here forever ?
how would you change your relationships and the negative energy in them ?
and more than anything , are you being the best parent you can ?
thank you .
the idea behind the stuxnet computer worm is actually quite simple .
we don 't want iran to get the bomb .
the gray boxes don 't run windows software they are a completely different technology .
and this is the plot behind stuxnet .
that 's easy , huh ?
i want to tell you how we found that out .
when we started our research on stuxnet six months ago , it was completely unknown what the purpose of this thing was .
so that got our attention , and we started a lab project where we infected our environment with stuxnet and checked this thing out .
and then some very funny things happened .
didn 't make sense to me .
and after we experimented with different flavors of cheese , i realized , well , this is a directed attack .
it 's completely directed .
and if not , stuxnet does nothing .
so that really got my attention , and we started to work on this nearly around the clock , because i thought , well , we don 't know what the target is .
it could be , let 's say for example , a u .s . power plant , or a chemical plant in germany .
so we better find out what the target is soon . 
and we also saw that they are very professionally engineered by people who obviously had all insider information .
they knew all the bits and bites that they had to attack .
so they know everything .
it 's way above everything that we have ever seen before .
here you see a sample of this actual attack code .
we are talking about around about , lines of code .
and i want to tell you how we were able to make sense out of this code .
so we do need target theories that we can prove or disprove .
now you don 't find several thousand targets in that area .
so i told my assistant , get me a list of all centrifuge and power plant experts from our client base . 
and that worked pretty well .
the rotor is that moving part within the centrifuge , that black object that you see .
and if you manipulate the speed of this rotor , you are actually able to crack the rotor and eventually even have the centrifuge explode .
the big digital warhead we had a shot at this by looking very closely at data and data structures .
so for example , the number really stands out in that code you can 't overlook it .
so that made sense , that was a match .
and it even got better .
these centrifuges in iran are subdivided into , what is called , stages .
an almost identical structure .
so again , that was a real good match .
and this gave us very high confidence for what we were looking at .
now don 't get me wrong here , it didn 't go like this .
these results have been obtained over several weeks of really hard labor .
and we often went into just a dead end and had to recover .
the small warhead is taking one cascade , and spinning up the rotors and slowing them down , and the big warhead is talking to six cascades and manipulating valves .
so in all , we are very confident that we have actually determined what the target is .
so we don 't have to worry that other targets might be hit by stuxnet .
here 's some very cool stuff that we saw really knocked my socks off .
down there is the gray box , and on the top you see the centrifuges .
and as a matter of fact , this fake input data is actually prerecorded by stuxnet .
that 's cool , huh ?
it actually is much more dangerous and aggressive .
the idea is to circumvent a digital safety system .
so this is where we need digital safety systems .
and when they are compromised , then real bad things can happen .
your plant can blow up .
that 's scary .
but it gets worse .
and this is very important , what i 'm going to say .
it doesn 't have anything to do , in specifics , with centrifuges , with uranium enrichment .
you could also use conventional worm technology for spreading .
just spread it as wide as possible .
and if you do that , what you end up with is a cyber weapon of mass destruction .
that 's the consequence that we have to face .
so unfortunately , the biggest number of targets for such attacks are not in the middle east .
they 're in the united states and europe and in japan .
we have to face the consequences , and we better start to prepare right now .
thanks .
i 've got a question .
is that your opinion ?
okay , you really want to hear that ?
yeah . okay .
so the leading force behind that is the cyber superpower .
there is only one , and that 's the united states fortunately , fortunately .
because otherwise , our problems would even be bigger .
thank you for scaring the living daylights out of us . thank you , ralph .
i have spent the past few years putting myself into situations that are usually very difficult and at the same time somewhat dangerous .
i went to prison difficult .
i worked in a coal mine dangerous .
i filmed in war zones difficult and dangerous .
and i spent days eating nothing but this fun in the beginning , little difficult in the middle , very dangerous in the end .
in fact , most of my career , i 've been immersing myself into seemingly horrible situations for the whole goal of trying to examine societal issues in a way that make them engaging , that make them interesting , that hopefully break them down in a way that make them entertaining and accessible to an audience .
so when i knew i was coming here to do a ted talk that was going to look at the world of branding and sponsorship , i knew i would want to do something a little different .
so as some of you may or may not have heard , a couple weeks ago , i took out an ad on ebay .
so what you were getting was this your name here presents my ted talk that you have no idea what the subject is and , depending on the content , could ultimately blow up in your face , especially if i make you or your company look stupid for doing it .
but that being said , it 's a very good media opportunity .
you know how many people watch these ted talks ?
it 's a lot .
that 's just a working title , by the way .
now if you 'd have asked me that a year ago , i wouldn 't have been able to tell you that with any certainty .
but in the new project that i 'm working on , my new film , we examine the world of marketing , advertising .
and as i said earlier , i put myself in some pretty horrible situations over the years , but nothing could prepare me , nothing could ready me , for anything as difficult or as dangerous as going into the rooms with these guys .
you see , i had this idea for a movie .
these people will be married to the film in perpetuity forever .
and so the film explores this whole idea it 's what ? in perpetuity , forever ?
i 'm a redundant person .
that was more for emphasis .
it was , in perpetuity . forever . 
so maybe we sell a shoe and it becomes the greatest shoe you ever wore . . .
so the idea is , beyond just showing that brands are a part of your life , but actually get them to finance the film ?
and actually we show the whole process of how does it work .
the goal of this whole film is transparency .
you 're going to see the whole thing take place in this movie .
so that 's the whole concept , the whole film , start to finish .
you know it 's funny , because when i first hear it , it is the ultimate respect for an audience .
i don 't know how receptive people are going to be to it , though .
how much money does it take to do this ?
 . million .
i think that you 're going to have a hard time meeting with them , but i think it 's certainly worth pursuing a couple big , really obvious brands .
who knows , maybe by the time your film comes out , we look like a bunch of blithering idiots .
what do you think the response is going to be ?
the responses mostly will be no . 
but is it a tough sell because of the film or a tough sell because of me ?
jk both .
 . . . meaning not so optimistic .
so , sir , can you help me ? i need help .
i can help you .
okay .
awesome .
we 've gotta figure out which brands .
yeah .
when you look at the people you deal with . .
we 've got some places we can go .
turn the camera off .
turns out it really means , we want nothing to do with your movie . 
and just like that , one by one , all of these companies suddenly disappeared .
none of them wanted anything to do with this movie .
i was amazed .
they wanted absolutely nothing to do with this project .
and i was blown away , because i thought the whole concept , the idea of advertising , was to get your product out in front of as many people as possible , to get as many people to see it as possible .
no , that 's what i thought .
but the problem was , you see , my idea had one fatal flaw , and that flaw was this .
actually no , that was not the flaw whatsoever .
that wouldn 't have been a problem at all .
this would have been fine .
but what this image represents was the problem .
see , when you do a google image search for transparency , this is this is one of the first images that comes up .
so i like the way you roll , sergey brin . no .
you see , we hear a lot about transparency these days .
our politicians say it , our president says it , even our ceo 's say it .
but suddenly when it comes down to becoming a reality , something suddenly changes .
but why ? well , transparency is scary like that odd , still screaming bear .
it 's unpredictable like this odd country road .
and it 's also very risky .
what else is risky ?
eating an entire bowl of cool whip .
that 's very risky .
now when i started talking to companies and telling them that we wanted to tell this story , and they said , no , we want you to tell a story .
we want you to tell a story , but we just want to tell our story . 
see , when i was a kid and my father would catch me in some sort of a lie and there he is giving me the look he often gave me he would say , son , there 's three sides to every story .
there 's your story , there 's my story and there 's the real story . 
now you see , with this film , we wanted to tell the real story .
so what you suddenly started to realize or what i started to realize is that when you started having conversations with these companies , the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem .
i have friends who make great big , giant hollywood films , and i have friends who make little independent films like i make .
and then my friends who make small independent films say , well , how are we supposed to compete with these big , giant hollywood movies ? 
so how specifically will we see ban in the film ?
while anytime i do an interview with someone , i can say , are you fresh enough for this interview ?
are you ready ? you look a little nervous .
i want to help you calm down .
so maybe you should put some one before the interview . 
we will have them geared for both male or female solid , roll on or stick , whatever it may be .
that 's the two cent tour .
we are a smaller brand .
much like you talked about being a smaller movie , we 're very much a challenger brand .
so we don 't have the budgets that other brands have .
so doing things like this you know , remind people about ban is kind of why were interested in it .
what are the words that you would use to describe ban ?
ban is blank .
that 's a great question .
technology 's not the way you want to describe something somebody 's putting in their armpit .
we talk about bold , fresh .
i think fresh is a great word that really spins this category into the positive , versus fights odor and wetness . 
it keeps you fresh .
how do we keep you fresher longer better freshness , more freshness , three times fresher .
things like that that are more of that positive benefit .
and that 's a multi million dollar corporation .
i need to go talk to the man on the street , the people who are like me , the regular joes .
they need to tell me about my brand .
how would you guys describe your brand ?
um , my brand ?
i don 't know .
i like really nice clothes .
unique .
i like a lot of black colors , a lot of grays and stuff like that .
but usually i have an accessory , like sunglasses , or i like crystal and things like that too .
if dan were a brand , he might be a classic convertible mercedes benz .
part hippie , part yogi , part brooklyn girl i don 't know .
so i guess that 's my brand .
in my warped little industry , that 's my brand .
is that something ?
i 'm tom .
and what i realized is i needed an expert .
if they could do it for them , surely they could do it for me .
you brought your pictures , right ?
i did . the very first picture is a picture of my family .
so tell me a little bit how it relates to your thoughts and feelings about who you are .
these are the people who shape the way i look at the world .
tell me about this world .
this world ? i think your world is the world that you live in like people who are around you , your friends , your family , the way you live your life , the job you do .
all those things stemmed and started from one place , and for me they stemmed and started with my family in west virginia .
what 's the next one you want to talk about ?
the next one this was the best day ever .
how does this relate to your thoughts and feelings about who you are ?
it 's like , who do i want to be ?
i like things that are different .
i like things that are weird . i like weird things .
tell me about the why phase what does that do for us ?
tell me a little bit about that part .
 . . . a little more about you that is not who you are .
 . . . doesn 't have to be fear . what kind of roller coaster are you on ?
thanks for you patience .
yeah . all right .
yeah , i don 't know what 's going to come of this .
there was a whole lot of crazy going on in there .
those are juxtaposed very nicely together .
and i think there 's almost a paradox with those .
and i think some companies will just focus on one of their strengths or the other instead of focusing on both .
most companies tend to and it 's human nature to avoid things that they 're not sure of , avoid fear , those elements , and you really embrace those , and you actually turn them into positives for you , and it 's a neat thing to see .
what other brands are like that ?
the first on here is the classic , apple .
or are you more of a down attribute ?
or are you more of a down attribute ?
over the course of this film , we had plus companies who were up and down companies saying , no , they didn 't want any part of this project .
they wanted nothing to do with this film , mainly because they would have no control , they would have no control over the final product .
and we went to school districts where now companies are making their way into cash strapped schools all across america .
what 's incredible for me is the projects that i 've gotten the most feedback out of , or i 've had the most success in , are ones where i 've interacted with things directly .
and that 's what these brands did .
they cut out the middleman , they cut out their agencies and said , maybe these agencies don 't have my best interest in mind .
i 'm going to deal directly with the artist .
i 'm going to work with him to create something different , something that 's going to get people thinking , that 's going to challenge the way we look at the world . 
and how has that been for them ? has it been successful ?
well , since the film premiered at the sundance film festival , let 's take a look .
that 's literally covering just like a two and a half week period .
that 's only online no print , no tv .
the film hasn 't even been distributed yet .
it 's not even online . it 's not even streaming .
it 's not even been out into other foreign countries yet .
so ultimately , this film has already started to gain a lot of momentum .
and not bad for a project that almost every ad agency we talked to advised their clients not to take part .
what i always believe is that if you take chances , if you take risks , that in those risks will come opportunity .
i believe that when you push people away from that , you 're pushing them more towards failure .
i believe that when you train your employees to be risk averse , then you 're preparing your whole company to be reward challenged .
i feel like that what has to happen moving forward is we need to encourage people to take risks .
we need to encourage people to not be afraid of opportunities that may scare them .
ultimately , moving forward , i think we have to embrace fear .
we 've got to put that bear in a cage .
embrace fear . embrace risk .
and ultimately , we have to embrace transparency .
today , more than ever , a little honesty is going to go a long way .
turning big data into big opportunity for organizations all over the world .
thank you very much , guys .
so , morgan , in the name of transparency , what exactly happened to that , ?
that is a fantastic question .
and months ago , i had another job at google , and i pitched this idea of doing something with museums and art to my boss who 's actually here , and she allowed me to do it .
and it took months .
but i 'm going to focus on the demo .
there are a lot of stories about why we did this .
i think my personal story is explained very simply on the slide , and it 's access .
and i grew up in india .
and so when i started traveling and going to these museums , i started learning a lot .
and while working at google , i tried to put this desire to make it more accessible with technology together .
so we formed a team , a great team of people , and we started doing this .
i 'm going to probably get into the demo and then tell you a couple of the interesting things we 've had since launch .
you look around at all these museums here .
i 'm going to actually get to one of my favorites , the metropolitan museum of art in new york .
two ways of going in very simple .
click and , bang , you 're in this museum .
it doesn 't matter where you are bombay , mexico , it doesn 't really matter .
you move around , you have fun .
you want to navigate around the museum ?
open the plan up , and , in one click , jump .
you 're in there , you want to go to the end of the corridor .
keep going . have fun .
explore .
thanks . i haven 't come to the best part .
i see this plus sign .
if the museum has given us the image , you click on it .
now this is one of the images .
so this is all of the meta data information .
for those of you who are truly interested in art , you can click this but i 'm going to click this off right now .
so i 'm going to try and show you what you really get for billion pixels .
you can zoom around very simply .
you see some fun stuff happening here .
i love this guy his expression is priceless .
but then you really want to go deep .
and so i started playing around , and i found something going on over here .
and i was like , hold on . that sounds interesting . 
went in , and i started noticing that these kids were actually beating something .
and apparently it was quite popular .
i don 't know why they did it , but i learned something about it .
now just to get really deep in , you can really get to the cracks .
now just to give you some perspective , i 'm going to zoom out so you really see what you get .
here is where we were , and this is the painting .
the best is yet to come so in a second .
so now let 's just quickly jump into the moma , again in new york .
so another one of my favorites , the starry night . 
now the example i showed you was all about finding details .
but what if you want to see brush strokes ?
and what if you want to see how van gogh actually created this masterpiece ?
this is the starry night , i think , never seen like this before .
i 'm going to show you my other favorite feature .
there 's a lot of other stuff here , but i don 't have time .
this is the real cool part . it 's called collections .
any one of you , anybody doesn 't matter if you 're rich , if you 're poor , if you have a fancy house doesn 't matter .
you can go and create your own museum online create your own collection across all these images .
you can annotate the stuff , send it to your friends and really get a conversation going about what you 're feeling when you go through these masterpieces .
so i think , in conclusion , for me , the main thing is that all the amazing stuff here does not really come from google .
it doesn 't , in my opinion , even come from the museums .
i probably shouldn 't say that .
it really comes from these artists .
and that 's been my humbling experience in this .
i mean , i hope in this digital medium that we do justice to their artwork and represent it properly online .
and the answer is no .
it 's to supplement the experience .
and that 's it . thank you .
thank you .
this is a representation of your brain , and your brain can be broken into two parts .
there 's the left half , which is the logical side , and then the right half , which is the intuitive .
and for example , this would be somebody who 's completely logical .
this would be someone who 's entirely intuitive .
so where would you put your brain on this scale ?
it 's not like they 're mutually exclusive or anything .
you can be logical and intuitive .
but at the same time , we need a good deal of intuition to actually make the experiments work .
how do we develop this intuition ? well we like to play with stuff .
so we go out and play with it , and then we see how it acts , and then we develop our intuition from there .
and really you do the same thing .
so some intuition that you may have developed over the years is that one thing is only in one place at a time .
i mean , it can sound weird to think about one thing being in two different places at the same time , but you weren 't born with this notion , you developed it .
he was just a toddler and he wasn 't very good at it , and he kept falling over .
and so this is a great conceptual model to have of the world , unless you 're a particle physicist .
and when they play with their particles , they find they do all sorts of really weird things like they can fly right through walls , or they can be in two different places at the same time .
and so they wrote down all these observations , and they called it the theory of quantum mechanics .
and so that 's where physics was at a few years ago you needed quantum mechanics to describe little , tiny particles .
but you didn 't need it to describe the large , everyday objects around us .
this didn 't really sit well with my intuition , and maybe it 's just because i don 't play with particles very often .
well , i play with them sometimes , but not very often .
and i 've never seen them .
i mean , nobody 's ever seen a particle .
but it didn 't sit well with my logical side either .
because if everything is made up of little particles and all the little particles follow quantum mechanics , then shouldn 't everything just follow quantum mechanics ?
i don 't see any reason why it shouldn 't .
and so i 'd feel a lot better about the whole thing if we could somehow show that an everyday object also follows quantum mechanics .
so a few years ago , i set off to do just that .
so i made one .
this is the first object that you can see that has been in a mechanical quantum superposition .
so what we 're looking at here is a tiny computer chip .
and you can sort of see this green dot right in the middle .
and that 's this piece of metal i 'm going to be talking about in a minute .
this is a photograph of the object .
and here i 'll zoom in a little bit . we 're looking right there in the center .
and then here 's a really , really big close up of the little piece of metal .
so what we 're looking at is a little chunk of metal , and it 's shaped like a diving board , and it 's sticking out over a ledge .
and so i made this thing in nearly the same way as you make a computer chip .
for the last stuff , i had to build my own machine to make this swimming pool shaped hole underneath the device .
this device has the ability to be in a quantum superposition , but it needs a little help to do it .
here , let me give you an analogy .
you know how uncomfortable it is to be in a crowded elevator ?
so quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects feel the same way .
the fellow passengers for inanimate objects are not just people , but it 's also the light shining on it and the wind blowing past it and the heat of the room .
and so we knew , if we wanted to see this piece of metal behave quantum mechanically , we 're going to have to kick out all the other passengers .
and so that 's what we did .
and so we measured its motion .
we found it was moving in really weird ways .
and by giving it a gentle nudge , we were able to make it both vibrate and not vibrate at the same time something that 's only allowed with quantum mechanics .
so what i 'm telling you here is something truly fantastic .
what does it mean for one thing to be both vibrating and not vibrating at the same time ?
so let 's think about the atoms .
so in one case all the trillions of atoms that make up that chunk of metal are sitting still and at the same time those same atoms are moving up and down .
that means that every atom is in two different places at the same time , which in turn means the entire chunk of metal is in two different places .
i think this is really cool .
really .
so if a single atom can be in two different places at the same time , that chunk of metal can be in two different places , then why not you ?
i mean , this is just my logical side talking .
so imagine if you 're in multiple places at the same time , what would that be like ?
there 's one more part to the story .
you hear a lot of talk about how quantum mechanics says that everything is all interconnected .
well , that 's not quite right .
it 's more than that it 's deeper .
it 's that those connections , your connections to all the things around you , literally define who you are , and that 's the profound weirdness of quantum mechanics .
thank you .
our new goal should be that when every family thinks about where they want to live and work , they should be able to choose between at least a handful of different cities that were all competing to attract new residents .
now we 're a long way away from that goal right now .
there are billions of people in developing countries who don 't have even a single city that would be willing to welcome them .
but the amazing thing about cities is they 're worth so much more than it costs to build them .
now this might sound preposterous to you if you 've never thought about new cities .
but just substitute apartment building for cities .
imagine half the people who wanted to be in apartments already had them the other half aren 't there yet .
you could try and expand the capacity by doing additions on all the existing apartments .
but you know what you 'd run into is those apartments and the surrounding areas have rules to avoid discomfort and the distractions of construction .
so it 's extremely hard to do all of those additions .
but you could go out someplace brand new , build a brand new apartment building , as long as the rules there were ones that facilitated construction rather than getting in the way .
so i proposed that governments create new reform zones big enough to hold cities and gave them a name charter cities .
meanwhile , i was getting ready to give a talk at tedglobal .
through a process of refinement , trial and error , a lot of user testing , i tried to boil this complicated concept of charter city down to the bare essentials .
the first point was the importance of rules , like those rules that say you can 't come in and disturb all the existing apartment holders .
we pay a lot of attention to new technologies , but it takes technologies and rules to get progress , and it 's usually the rules that hold us back .
in the fall of , a friend from guatemala sent octavio a link to the tedtalk .
they called me .
they said , let 's present this to the leaders of our country . 
so in december we met in miami , in a hotel conference room .
i tried to explain this point about how valuable cities are , how much more valuable they are than they cost .
but it was a fairly abstract discussion , and at some point when there was a pause , octavio said , paul , maybe we could watch the tedtalk . 
so i was asked by the president of honduras who said that we need to do this project , this is important , this could be the way forward for our country .
so i presented another fact filled lecture that included a slide like this , which tried to make the point that , if you want to create a lot of value in a city , it has to be very big .
this is a picture of denver , and the outline is the new airport that was built in denver .
this airport alone covers more than square kilometers .
that 's more than hundred thousand acres .
everybody applauded politely .
the faces in the audience were very serious and attentive .
i 've got it here on my laptop . 
so i sat down , and they played the tedtalk .
and it got to the essence , which is that a new city could offer new choices for people .
there would be a choice of a city which you could go to which could be in honduras , instead of hundreds of miles away in the north .
and it also involved new choices for leaders .
and the insight of president lobo was that that assurance of enforcement that i was thinking about as a way to get the foreign investors to come in and build the city could be equally important for all the different parties in honduras who had suffered for so many years from fear and distrust .
we went and looked at a site .
this picture 's from there .
it easily could hold a thousand square kilometers .
in a country which had just gone through this wrenching crisis , the vote in the congress in favor of this constitutional amendment was to one .
all parties , all factions in society , backed this .
to be part of the constitution , you actually have to pass it twice in the congress .
on february th they passed it again with another vote of to one .
one is south korea .
this is a picture of a big , new city center that 's being built in south korea bigger than downtown boston .
everything you see there was built in four years , after they spent four years getting the permits .
the other place that 's very interested in city building is singapore .
they 've actually built two cities already in china and are preparing the third .
so if you think about this practically , here 's where we are .
they 've got a site they 're already thinking about this site for the second city .
they 're putting in place a legal system that could allow for managers to come in , and also an external legal system .
they even can bring with them some financing .
but the one thing you know they 've already solved is that there 's lots of tenants .
there 's lots of businesses that would like to locate in the americas , especially in a place with a free trade zone , and there 's lots of people who 'd like to go there .
around the world , there 's million people who say they 'd like to move permanently someplace else right now .
there 's a million a year who leave latin america to go to the united states .
many of these are a father who has to leave his family behind to go get a job sometimes a single mother who has to get enough money to even pay for food or clothing .
sadly , sometimes there are even children who are trying to get reunited with their parents that they haven 't seen , in some cases , for a decade .
so what kind of an idea is it to think about building a brand new city in honduras ?
what kind of an idea is it to think about insisting that every family have a choice of several cities that are competing to attract new residents ?
this is an idea worth spreading .
and my friends from honduras asked me to say thank you , ted .
do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
there was also recently a study done with ceos in which they followed ceos around for a whole week .
and these scientists simply documented all the various tasks that these ceos engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these tasks .
and they found that the average ceo engaged in about tasks in a week .
each task was made up of many , many , many sub choices of course .
 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
only about percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time .
think about your own choices .
do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute category versus your one hour category ?
how well do you think you 're doing at managing those choices ?
i want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
now as i talk about this problem , i 'm going to have some questions for you and i 'm going to want to know your answers .
so when i ask you a question , since i 'm blind , only raise your hand if you want to burn off some calories .
thank you .
now this store , it was almost like going to an amusement park .
i used to love going to this store , but on one occasion i asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ?
here 's their olive oil aisle .
so i one day decided to pay a visit to the manager , and i asked the manager , is this model of offering people all this choice really working ? 
we decided to do a little experiment , and we picked jam for our experiment .
here 's their jam aisle .
they had different kinds of jam .
we there put out six different flavors of jam or different flavors of jam , and we looked at two things first , in which case were people more likely to stop , sample some jam ?
more people stopped when there were , about percent , than when there were six , about percent .
the next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a jar of jam .
now we see the opposite effect .
of the people who stopped when there were , only three percent of them actually bought a jar of jam .
of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that percent of them actually bought a jar of jam .
now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a jar of jam if they encountered six than if they encountered .
we choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best self interests .
so now for the topic of today financial savings .
and what we found was that indeed there was a correlation .
so in these plans , we had about plans that ranged from offering people anywhere from two to different fund offerings .
and what we found was that , the more funds offered , indeed , there was less participation rate .
now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences .
now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would recommend for people when you 're considering their future financial well being .
well , over the past decade , we have observed three main negative consequences to offering people more and more choices .
they 're more likely to delay choosing procrastinate even when it goes against their best self interest .
they 're more likely to make worse choices worse financial choices , medical choices .
they 're more likely to choose things that make them less satisfied , even when they do objectively better .
the first cut .
you 've heard it said before , but it 's never been more true than today , that less is more .
people are always upset when i say , cut . 
the typical walmart today offers you , products .
for those people who actually want to choose , they 're given funds , not or more funds .
you know , often , people say , i don 't know how to cut .
they 're all important choices . 
and the first thing i do is i ask the employees , tell me how these choices are different from one another .
and if your employees can 't tell them apart , neither can your consumers . 
now before we started our session this afternoon , i had a chat with gary .
and gary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an all expenses paid free vacation to the most beautiful road in the world .
here 's a description of the road .
and i 'd like you to read it .
and now i 'll give you a few seconds to read it and then i want you to clap your hands if you 're ready to take gary up on his offer .
okay . anybody who 's ready to take him up on his offer .
is that all ?
all right , let me show you some more about this .
you guys knew there was a trick , didn 't you .
now who 's ready to go on this trip .
i think i might have actually heard more hands .
all right .
now in fact , you had objectively more information the first time around than the second time around , but i would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
that in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vivid sort of way , in a very concrete way .
why do people spend an average of to percent more when they use an atm card or a credit card as opposed to cash ?
because it doesn 't feel like real money .
and it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
and during that session , we kept the session exactly the way it used to be , but we added one little thing .
the one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more .
by doing that simple thing , there was an increase in enrollment by percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent .
we can handle more categories than we can handle choices .
but you know what ?
because the categories tell me how to tell them apart .
one is called jazz and the other one is called swing . 
if you think the display on the left is swing and the display on the right is jazz , clap your hands .
okay , there 's some .
if you think the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing , clap your hands .
okay , a bit more .
now it turns out you 're right .
the one on the left is jazz and the one on the right is swing , but you know what ?
and you often see that problem when it comes down to those long lists of all these funds .
who are they actually supposed to be informing ?
my fourth technique condition for complexity .
it turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can , we 've just got to take it a little easier .
we have to gradually increase the complexity .
i 'm going to show you one example of what i 'm talking about .
let 's take a very , very complicated decision buying a car .
you 've got to make different decisions , completely make up your car .
now these decisions vary in the number of choices that they offer per decision .
so now what i 'm going to do is i 'm going to vary the order in which these decisions appear .
what am i going to look at ?
how engaged you are .
we 're losing them .
they go from low choice to high choice , they 're hanging in there .
it 's the same information . it 's the same number of choices .
the only thing that i have done is i have varied the order in which that information is presented .
if i start you off easy , i learn how to choose .
it also gets me excited about this big product that i 'm putting together , so i 'm more willing to be motivated to be engaged .
so let me recap .
all of these techniques that i 'm describing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are serving .
because i believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choosy about choosing .
and the more we 're able to be choosy about choosing the better we will be able to practice the art of choosing .
thank you very much .
it 's true .
so we 're going to talk a little bit today about how videos go viral and then why that even matters .
we all want to be stars celebrities , singers , comedians and when i was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
but now web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world 's culture .
any one of you could be famous on the internet by next saturday .
but there are over hours of video uploaded to youtube every minute .
and of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes viral and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
so how does it happen ?
all right , let 's go .
oh , my god . oh , my god .
oh , my god !
wooo !
in , it was viewed million times .
this is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
but he didn 't actually set out to make a viral video , bear .
he just wanted to share a rainbow .
because that 's what you do when your name is yosemite mountain bear .
and this video had actually been posted all the way back in january .
so what happened here ?
jimmy kimmel actually .
jimmy kimmel posted this tweet that would eventually propel the video to be as popular as it would become .
it 's been seen nearly million times this year .
this is a chart of what it looked like .
so what happened on this day ?
well it was a friday , this is true .
and if you 're wondering about those other spikes , those are also fridays .
but what about this day , this one particular friday ?
and so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
even in the first seven days , there was one parody for every other day of the week .
unlike the one way entertainment of the th century , this community participation is how we become a part of the phenomenon either by spreading it or by doing something new with it .
it 's this , just like this .
it 's been viewed nearly million times this year .
even cats were watching this video .
cats were watching other cats watch this video .
there were remixes .
someone made an old timey version .
and then it went international .
because we don 't just enjoy now , we participate .
and who could have predicted any of this ?
what scripts could you have written that would have contained this in it ?
so i got a ticket for not riding in the bike lane , but often there are obstructions that keep you from properly riding in the bike lane .
and so this approach holds for anything new that we do creatively .
and so it all brings us to one big question . . .
what does this mean ?
ohhhh .
what does it mean ?
i mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , justin bieber , got his start on youtube .
no one has to green light your idea .
and we all now feel some ownership in our own pop culture .
and these are not characteristics of old media , and they 're barely true of the media of today , but they will define the entertainment of the future .
thank you .
how can i speak in minutes about the bonds of women over three generations , about how the astonishing strength of those bonds took hold in the life of a four year old girl huddled with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and nights in a small boat in the china sea more than years ago , bonds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go that small girl now living in san francisco and speaking to you today ?
this is not a finished story .
it is a jigsaw puzzle still being put together .
imagine the first piece a man burning his life 's work .
he is a poet , a playwright , a man whose whole life had been balanced on the single hope of his country 's unity and freedom .
he retreated into silence .
he died broken by history .
he is my grandfather .
i never knew him in real life .
but our lives are much more than our memories .
my grandmother never let me forget his life .
my duty was not to allow it to have been in vain , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to crush us , but we endured .
my mother , mai , was when her father died already in an arranged marriage , already with two small girls .
for her , life had distilled itself into one task the escape of her family and a new life in australia .
it was inconceivable to her that she would not succeed .
all the adults knew the risks .
the greatest fear was of pirates , rape and death .
no apple has ever tasted the same .
after three months in a refugee camp , we landed in melbourne .
my mother worked on farms , then on a car assembly line , working six days , double shifts .
somehow she found time to study english and gain it qualifications .
we were poor .
two pairs of stockings for school , each to hide the holes in the other .
go home to where ?
there was a gathering of resolve and a quiet voice saying , i will bypass you . 
my mother , my sister and i slept in the same bed .
my mother was exhausted each night , but we told one another about our day and listened to the movements of my grandmother around the house .
and my job was to stay awake until her nightmares came so i could wake her .
grants and sponsors were sought .
centers were established .
in one , i was the classic asian student , relentless in the demands that i made on myself .
but so many over the years were helped .
i didn 't know the protocols .
i didn 't know how to use the cutlery .
i didn 't know how to talk about wine .
i didn 't know how to talk about anything .
i told my mother i couldn 't do it .
she reminded me that i was now the same age she had been when we boarded the boat .
no had never been an option .
 just do it , she said , and don 't be what you 're not . 
and the more candidly i spoke , the more i was asked to speak .
i met people from all walks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the frontiers of possibility .
and even though i finished my degree , i realized i could not settle into a career in law .
and i realized at the same time that it is okay to be an outsider , a recent arrival , new on the scene and not just okay , but something to be thankful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
because being an insider can so easily mean collapsing the horizons , can so easily mean accepting the presumptions of your province .
so i followed my hunches .
i gathered around me a small team of people for whom the label it can 't be done was an irresistible challenge .
for a year we were penniless .
at the end of each day , i made a huge pot of soup which we all shared .
we worked well into each night .
most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
i made the decision to move to the u .s .
after only one trip .
my hunches again .
three months later i had relocated , and the adventure has continued .
before i close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
life hadn 't changed for centuries .
her father died soon after she was born .
her mother raised her alone .
at she became the second wife of a mandarin whose mother beat her .
 it can 't be done was shown to be wrong .
i was taking a shower in a hotel room in sydney the moment she died miles away in melbourne .
i knew she had come to say goodbye .
my mother phoned minutes later .
we told her stories and assured her that we were still with her .
at midnight the monk came and told us he had to close the casket .
my mother asked us to feel her hand .
she asked the monk , why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? 
 because you have been holding it since this morning , he said .
 you have not let it go . 
if there is a sinew in our family , it runs through the women .
defeat would have come too easily .
now i would like to have my own children , and i wonder about the boat .
who could ever wish it on their own ?
i don 't know .
but if i could give it and still see them safely through , i would .
i 'm here to share my photography .
or is it photography ?
because , of course , this is a photograph that you can 't take with your camera .
yet , my interest in photography started as i got my first digital camera at the age of .
it mixed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
and when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the trigger .
so to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
i felt like anyone could do that .
so i wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the trigger .
photos like this construction going on along a busy road .
but it has an unexpected twist .
and despite that , it retains a level of realism .
or photos like these both dark and colorful , but all with a common goal of retaining the level of realism .
when i say realism , i mean photo realism .
because , of course , it 's not something you can capture really , but i always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
photos where you will need a brief moment to think to figure out the trick .
so it 's more about capturing an idea than about capturing a moment really .
but what 's the trick that makes it look realistic ?
is it something about the details or the colors ?
is it something about the light ?
what creates the illusion ?
sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
but in the end , it comes down to how we interpret the world and how it can be realized on a two dimensional surface .
it 's not really what is realistic , it 's what we think looks realistic really .
so i think the basics are quite simple .
i just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alternate reality .
and let me show you a simple example .
here we have three perfectly imaginable physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three dimensional world .
but combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three dimensional , like it could exist .
but at the same time , we know it can 't .
so we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn 't accept the fact that it doesn 't really make sense .
and i see the same process with combining photographs .
it 's just really about combining different realities .
so the things that make a photograph look realistic , i think it 's the things that we don 't even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
but when combining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
so i would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a realistic result .
as you can see , these images aren 't really special .
but combined , they can create something like this .
so the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
the third one is about making it impossible to distinguish where the different images begin and end by making it seamless .
make it impossible to say how the image actually was composed .
so here 's another example .
one might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what 's manipulated .
but this image is actually entirely composed of photographs from different locations .
i personally think that it 's easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don 't need to compromise with the ideas in your head .
but it does require a lot of planning .
and getting this idea during winter , i knew that i had several months to plan it , to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
the shores are from a different location .
the underwater part was captured in a stone pit .
so to achieve a realistic result , i think it comes down to planning .
it always starts with a sketch , an idea .
then it 's about combining the different photographs .
and here every piece is very well planned .
and if you do a good job capturing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite realistic .
so all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
thank you .
i would like to talk to you about why many e health projects fail .
and i really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
not in a very scientific way she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients , family , relatives , what 's up ?
how could we help you ? 
and we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all maybe not all but most of the e health projects fail , since we stopped listening .
this is my wifi scale . it 's a very simple thing .
it 's got one knob , on off .
and every morning i hop on it .
and yes , i 've got a challenge , as you might see .
and i put my challenge on kg .
but the thing is that it 's made this simple that whenever i hop on , it sends my data through google health as well .
but there 's another thing .
as some of you might know , i 've got more than , followers on twitter .
but on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gaming activity to get more control of their health .
as of next week , it will soon be available .
there will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iphone or something or other .
and people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
make techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team .
and you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crowd sourcing .
and one of the things we did i would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
we 've all got navigation controls in our car .
we maybe even have it in our cellphone .
we know perfectly where all the atms are about the city of maastricht .
the other thing is we know where all the gas stations are .
and sure , we could find fast food chains .
so what we did , we crowdsourced the netherlands .
the next step we took was to find the applications for it .
and we built an ipad application .
and we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
so please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
thank you .
today i 'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries .
and my small startup is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to . . .
 . . . paying attention to crowd sourcing .
it 's just a quick video of what we do .
huh . hang on a moment .
it might take a moment to load .
we 'll just we can just skip i 'll just skip through the video instead . . .
no .
this is not . . .
okay .
oh , that 's all my time ?
okay . thank you very much .
so a couple of years ago i started a program to try to get the rockstar tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they 're supposed to hate we have them work in government .
the program is called code for america , and it 's a little bit like a peace corps for geeks .
and there they make great apps , they work with city staffers .
but really what they 're doing is they 're showing what 's possible with technology today .
so meet al .
now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique manner ?
we had a team of fellows in boston last year through the code for america program .
they were there in february , and it snowed a lot in february last year .
and they noticed that the city never gets to digging out these fire hydrants .
so he did what any good developer would do , he wrote an app .
it 's a cute little app where you can adopt a fire hydrant .
so you agree to dig it out when it snows .
if you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one al .
and if you don 't , someone can steal it from you .
so it 's got cute little game dynamics on it .
this is a modest little app .
it 's probably the smallest of the apps that the fellows wrote last year .
it 's spreading virally .
there 's a guy in the i .t . department of the city of honolulu who saw this app and realized that he could use it , not for snow , but to get citizens to adopt tsunami sirens .
it 's very important that these tsunami sirens work , but people steal the batteries out of them .
so he 's getting citizens to check on them .
so we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
procuring software usually takes a couple of years .
we had a team that worked on a project in boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
it was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
we were told afterward that if that had gone through normal channels , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
and that 's nothing .
there is one project in the california court system right now that so far cost taxpayers two billion dollars , and it doesn 't work .
and there are projects like this at every level of government .
so an app that takes a couple of days to write and then spreads virally , that 's sort of a shot across the bow to the institution of government .
it suggests how government could work better not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
and not even like a tech company , but more like the internet itself .
and that 's important .
and that 's great news , because , it turns out , we 're very good at collective action with digital technology .
now there 's a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
it 's not just code for america fellows , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civic apps every day in their own communities .
they haven 't given up on government .
they are frustrated as hell with it , but they 're not complaining about it , they 're fixing it .
and these folks know something that we 've lost sight of .
now a lot of people have given up on government .
politics is not changing government is changing .
and because government ultimately derives its power from us remember we the people ? how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
now i didn 't know very much about government when i started this program .
and like a lot of people , i thought government was basically about getting people elected to office .
this is the call center for the services and information line .
boston doesn 't just have a call center .
it has an app , a web and mobile app , called citizens connect .
now we didn 't write this app .
how do i get this removed ? 
but what happens with citizens connect is different .
so scott was speaking person to person .
but on citizens connect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
and in this case , a neighbor saw it .
and the next report we got said , i walked over to this location , found the trashcan behind the house .
turned trashcan on its side . walked home .
pretty simple .
so this is great . this is the digital meeting the physical .
and it 's also a great example of government getting in on the crowd sourcing game .
but it 's also a great example of government as a platform .
and i don 't mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
i 'm just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
so one citizen helped another citizen , but government played a key role here .
it connected those two people .
and it could have connected them with government services if they 'd been needed , but a neighbor is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
when one neighbor helps another , we strengthen our communities .
now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it 's not the same thing as politics .
and most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
that our input to the system of government is voting .
now how many times have we elected a political leader and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elected and then we sit back and we expect government to reflect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
that 's because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six inch layer on top .
and what 's under that is what we call bureaucracy .
and we say that word with such contempt .
but it 's that contempt that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that 's working against us , this other thing , and then we 're disempowering ourselves .
people seem to think politics is sexy .
if we want this institution to work for us , we 're going to have to make bureaucracy sexy .
because that 's where the real work of government happens .
we have to engage with the machinery of government .
have you seen these guys ?
that 's not being politically active , that 's being bureaucratically active .
now for those of us who 've given up on government , it 's time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
you have to see the enormous challenges that they 're going to face .
do we really think we 're going to get where we need to go without fixing the one institution that can act on behalf of all of us ?
we can 't do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
and there 's a generation out there that 's grown up on the internet , and they know that it 's not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
this is a generation that 's grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted .
they 're not fighting that battle that we 're all fighting about who gets to speak they all get to speak .
they can express their opinion on any channel at any time , and they do .
so when they 're faced with the problem of government , they don 't care as much about using their voices .
they 're using their hands .
they 're using their hands to write applications that make government work better .
and those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
but these apps are like little digital reminders that we 're not just consumers , and we 're not just consumers of government , putting in our taxes and getting back services .
we 're more than that , we 're citizens .
and we 're not going to fix government until we fix citizenship .
so the question i have for all of you here when it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
thank you .
because i usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and i thought that , since i was among friends here , i would tell you what i really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing jumps in technology that seem so fast that we can barely keep on top of it .
so i 'm going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
and then , so if you can just turn on the slide that 's on .
this is just a random slide that i picked out of my file .
what i want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
and the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology slides that we 're used to , is a sort of a straight line on a semi log curve .
and this is a new thing that we talk about technology on semi log curves .
something really weird is going on here .
and that 's basically what i 'm going to be talking about .
so , if you could bring up the lights .
if you could bring up the lights higher , because i 'm just going to use a piece of paper here .
now why do we draw technology curves in semi log curves ?
well the answer is , if i drew it on a normal curve where , let 's say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that i 'm trying to graph , the graphs look sort of silly .
they sort of go like this .
and they don 't tell us much .
but when something like this happens , things are qualitatively changing .
it 's not moving like that .
now the question that i 'd like to ask is , if you look at these exponential curves , they don 't go on forever .
things just can 't possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
one of two things is going to happen .
either it 's going to turn into a sort of classical s curve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it 's going to do this .
that 's about all it can do .
now i 'm an optimist , so i sort of think it 's probably going to do something like that .
if so , that means that what we 're in the middle of right now is a transition .
we 're sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
and so what i 'm trying to ask , what i 've been asking myself , is what 's this new way that the world is ?
what 's that new state that the world is heading toward ?
because the transition seems very , very confusing when we 're right in the middle of it .
now when i was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year .
now here 's a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year .
it 's about as far as we go out .
so in other words , the future has kind of been shrinking one year per year for my whole lifetime .
now i think that the reason is because we all feel that something 's happening there .
that transition is happening . we can all sense it .
and we know that it just doesn 't make too much sense to think out , years because everything 's going to be so different that a simple extrapolation of what we 're doing just doesn 't make any sense at all .
so what i would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we 're going through .
now in order to do that i 'm going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
because i think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
so the time scale that i would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on earth .
so i think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
and if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
and some of those drops of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to incorporate chemicals from the outside and grow the drops of oil .
and those that were like that started to split and divide .
but now those drops of oil weren 't really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random recipe of chemicals .
and every time it divided , they got sort of unequal division of the chemicals within them .
and so every drop was a little bit different .
so those tended to live longer , get expressed more .
now that 's sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these drops learned a trick about abstraction .
somehow by ways that we don 't quite understand , these little drops learned to write down information .
they learned to record the information that was the recipe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called dna .
the amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed steady since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
in fact the recipe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
in fact , every living creature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
but this has in it what i did is i took this code the code has standard letters that we use for symbolizing it and i wrote my business card onto a piece of dna and amplified it to the times .
so if anyone would like a hundred million copies of my business card , i have plenty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it 's right here .
so what was the next step ?
but then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started exchanging and communicating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
i don 't know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange dna .
now that 's why , for instance , antibiotic resistance has evolved .
some bacteria figured out how to stay away from penicillin , and it went around sort of creating its little dna information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resistant to penicillin , because bacteria communicate .
so they survived or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repeated more and they were favored by evolution .
and so the next stage that 's interesting in life took about another billion years .
and in fact , we 're such a multi cellular community .
we have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
your skin cell is really useless without a heart cell , muscle cell , a brain cell and so on .
now the next step that happened is within these communities .
and they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
and those are the neural structures .
and in fact , they began to get specialists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recording , understanding , learning information .
and that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
and that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
because at that point , an individual learning could happen within the time span of a single organism , instead of over this evolutionary time span .
so an organism could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fruit because it tasted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
but then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tricks of communicating .
it 's really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
but we 're taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
so this allows us now to begin to start functioning as a single organism .
and so , in fact , what we 've done is we , humanity , have started abstracting out .
so for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
and it all connects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before .
so now , evolution can take place on a scale of microseconds .
so the first steps of the story that i told you about took a billion years a piece .
and the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
and these next steps , like electronics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
the more it changes , the faster it changes .
and i think that that 's what we 're seeing here in this explosion of curve .
we 're seeing this process feeding back on itself .
now i design computers for a living , and i know that the mechanisms that i use to design computers would be impossible without recent advances in computers .
so right now , what i do is i design objects at such complexity that it 's really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
there are billions of them .
and in fact , sometimes it takes it by methods that we don 't quite even understand .
one method that 's particularly interesting that i 've been using a lot lately is evolution itself .
so what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the microsecond time scale .
so for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequences of instructions .
now would you please run all of those random sequences of instructions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came closest to doing what i wanted . 
so in other words , i define what i wanted .
let 's say i want to sort numbers , as a simple example i 've done it with .
so find the programs that come closest to sorting numbers .
so of course , random sequences of instructions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
but one of them , by luck , may put two numbers in the right order .
and i say , computer , would you please now take the percent of those random sequences that did the best job .
so i 've got now a new generation of programs that are produced by combinations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
say , please repeat that process . 
score them again .
introduce some mutations perhaps .
and try that again and do that for another generation .
well every one of those generations just takes a few milliseconds .
so i can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
at the end of that , i end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sorting numbers .
in fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs i could have ever written by hand .
now if i look at those programs , i can 't tell you how they work .
i 've tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
they 're obscure , weird programs .
but they do the job .
and in fact , i know , i 'm very confident that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
in fact , their life depended on doing the job .
in fact , we know that the engineering process doesn 't work very well when it gets complicated .
so we 're beginning to depend on computers to do a process that 's very different than engineering .
and it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
and yet , we don 't quite understand the options of it .
we 're now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we 'll be able to run this process much faster .
so it 's feeding back on itself .
the thing is becoming faster and that 's why i think it seems so confusing .
because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
we 're taking off .
and what we are is we 're at a point in time which is analogous to when single celled organisms were turning into multi celled organisms .
so we 're the amoebas and we can 't quite figure out what the hell this thing is we 're creating .
but i think that there really is something coming along after us .
and i think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
my story begins right here actually in rajasthan about two years ago .
and we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient indian epic the mahabharata . 
so back in the day , when us indians wanted to travel we 'd jump into a chariot and we 'd zoom across the sky .
now we do the same with airplanes .
the conclusion that we came to was that magic had been replaced by machinery .
and this made me really sad .
i was terrified by this idea that i would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sunset without having my camera on me , without tweeting it to my friends .
and it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it .
so i felt like our cellphones and our fancy watches and our cameras had stopped us from dreaming .
they stopped us from being inspired .
and so i jumped in , i jumped into this world of technology , to see how i could use it to enable magic as opposed to kill it .
i 've been illustrating books since i was .
and so when i saw the ipad , i saw it as a storytelling device that could connect readers all over the world .
it can know how we 're holding it .
it can know where we are .
it brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch .
storytelling is becoming more and more multi sensorial .
but what are we doing with it ?
so it says , place your fingers upon each light . 
and so it says , this box belongs to . . . and so i type in my name .
and actually i become a character in the book .
the child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
now i 've been talking a lot about magic .
and i don 't mean wizards and dragons , i mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all harbored as children .
this idea of fireflies in a jar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
and so over here you need to tilt your ipad , take the fireflies out .
and they actually illuminate your way through the rest of the book .
another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be contained within a single marble .
and so over here , each book and each world becomes a little marble that i drag in to this magical device within the device .
and it opens up a map .
this is a map that grows and glows and becomes your navigation for the rest of the book .
it reveals itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
so i 'm just going to enter in .
and so we 're bringing them back in a contemporary story for children .
and a story that actually deals with new issues like the environmental crisis .
speaking of the environmental crisis , i think a big problem has been in the last years is that children have been locked inside their rooms , glued to their pcs , they haven 't been able to get out .
but now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
one of the interactions in the book is that you 're sent off on this quest where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the ipad and collect pictures of different natural objects .
and somehow kids don 't do that anymore .
in another chapter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bark and then tag that .
and what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online .
a child in india says , i saw a monkey today . 
and it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you 've actually taken .
in the possibilities of linking together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities .
at one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
and so you need to make the sound of wind and blow them away and read the rest of the book .
we 're moving , we 're all moving here , to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology , and magic and technology can come closer together .
we 're harnessing energy from the sun .
we 're bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story .
thank you .
well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
and being here at ted and seeing the stimulation , hearing it , has been very , very energizing to me .
and one of the things that 's emerged in my short time here is that ted has an identity .
and you can actually say things here that have impacts around the world .
and sometimes when it comes through ted , it has meaning and power that it doesn 't have when it doesn 't .
and i mention that because i think identity is really important .
and we 've had some fantastic presentations .
and i think what we 've learned is that , if you 're a teacher your words can be meaningful , but if you 're a compassionate teacher , they can be especially meaningful .
and so i want to talk about the power of identity .
and i didn 't learn about this actually practicing law and doing the work that i do .
i actually learned about this from my grandmother .
i grew up in a house that was the traditional african american home that was dominated by a matriarch , and that matriarch was my grandmother .
she was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
she was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family .
her parents were born in slavery in virginia in the 's .
she was born in the 's and the experience of slavery very much shaped the way she saw the world .
and my grandmother was tough , but she was also loving .
when i would see her as a little boy , she 'd come up to me and she 'd give me these hugs .
and she 'd squeeze me so tight i could barely breathe and then she 'd let me go .
and an hour or two later , if i saw her , she 'd come over to me and she 'd say , bryan , do you still feel me hugging you ? 
and if i said , no , she 'd assault me again , and if i said , yes , she 'd leave me alone .
and she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
and the only challenge was that she had children .
my mom was the youngest of her kids .
and sometimes when i would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
my cousins would be running around everywhere .
and i remember , when i was about eight or nine years old , waking up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cousins were running around .
and my grandmother was sitting across the room staring at me .
and at first i thought we were playing a game .
and i would look at her and i 'd smile , but she was very serious .
and after about or minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , come on , bryan . you and i are going to have a talk . 
and i remember this just like it happened yesterday .
i never will forget it .
i said , okay , mama . 
then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , i want you to know i 've been watching you . 
and she said , i think you 're special . 
she said , i think you can do anything you want to do . 
i will never forget it .
and then she said , i just need you to promise me three things , bryan . 
i said , okay , mama . 
she said , that 's my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you 'll always take care of her . 
well i adored my mom , so i said , yes , mama . i 'll do that . 
and i thought about it and i said , yes , mama . i 'll do that . 
then finally she said , the third thing i want you to promise me is that you 'll never drink alcohol . 
well i was nine years old , so i said , yes , mama . i 'll do that . 
i grew up in the country in the rural south , and i have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
and he had a sip of this beer and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they offered it to me .
i said , no , no , no . that 's okay . you all go ahead . i 'm not going to have any beer . 
my brother said , come on . we 're doing this today you always do what we do .
i had some , your sister had some . have some beer . 
i said , no , i don 't feel right about that . y 'all go ahead . y 'all go ahead . 
and then my brother started staring at me .
he said , what 's wrong with you ? have some beer . 
then he looked at me real hard and he said , oh , i hope you 're not still hung up on that conversation mama had with you . 
i said , well , what are you talking about ? 
he said , oh , mama tells all the grandkids that they 're special . 
i was devastated .
and i 'm going to admit something to you .
i 'm going to tell you something i probably shouldn 't .
i know this might be broadcast broadly .
but i 'm years old , and i 'm going to admit to you that i 've never had a drop of alcohol .
i don 't say that because i think that 's virtuous i say that because there is power in identity .
when we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don 't actually believe makes sense .
we can get them to do things that they don 't think they can do .
when i thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grandkids were special .
my grandfather was in prison during prohibition .
and these were the things she thought we needed to commit to .
well i 've been trying to say something about our criminal justice system .
this country is very different today than it was years ago .
today , there are . million .
the united states now has the highest rate of incarceration in the world .
in poor communities , in communities of color there is this despair , there is this hopelessness , that is being shaped by these outcomes .
we have a system of justice in this country that treats you much better if you 're rich and guilty than if you 're poor and innocent .
and yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
the politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
we 've been disconnected .
it 's interesting to me .
right now in alabama percent of the black male population has permanently lost the right to vote .
i represent children .
a lot of my clients are very young .
and we 're actually doing some litigation .
the only country in the world .
it 's interesting , this question of the death penalty .
and that 's a very sensible question .
but there 's another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
the other way of thinking about it is not , do people deserve to die for the crimes they commit , but do we deserve to kill ?
i mean , it 's fascinating .
death penalty in america is defined by error .
for every nine people who have been executed , we 've actually identified one innocent person who 's been exonerated and released from death row .
a kind of astonishing error rate one out of nine people innocent .
i mean , it 's fascinating .
in aviation , we would never let people fly on airplanes if for every nine planes that took off one would crash .
it 's not our problem .
it 's not our burden .
it 's not our struggle .
i talk a lot about these issues .
i talk about race and this question of whether we deserve to kill .
and it 's interesting , when i teach my students about african american history , i tell them about slavery .
i tell them about terrorism , the era that began at the end of reconstruction that went on to world war ii .
we don 't really know very much about it .
but for african americans in this country , that was an era defined by terror .
they had to worry about being bombed .
it was the threat of terror that shaped their lives .
and these older people come up to me now and they say , mr . stevenson , you give talks , you make speeches , you tell people to stop saying we 're dealing with terrorism for the first time in our nation 's history after . 
they tell me to say , no , tell them that we grew up with that . 
and that era of terrorism , of course , was followed by segregation and decades of racial subordination and apartheid .
and yet , we have in this country this dynamic where we really don 't like to talk about our problems .
we don 't like to talk about our history .
and because of that , we really haven 't understood what it 's meant to do the things we 've done historically .
we 're constantly running into each other .
we 're constantly creating tensions and conflicts .
we have a hard time talking about race , and i believe it 's because we are unwilling to commit ourselves to a process of truth and reconciliation .
in south africa , people understood that we couldn 't overcome apartheid without a commitment to truth and reconciliation .
in rwanda , even after the genocide , there was this commitment , but in this country we haven 't done that .
i was giving some lectures in germany about the death penalty .
it was fascinating because one of the scholars stood up after the presentation and said , well you know it 's deeply troubling to hear what you 're talking about . 
he said , we don 't have the death penalty in germany .
and of course , we can never have the death penalty in germany . 
and the room got very quiet , and this woman said , there 's no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the systematic killing of human beings .
and i thought about that .
what would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of germany was executing people , especially if they were disproportionately jewish ?
i couldn 't bear it .
and yet , there is this disconnect .
well i believe that our identity is at risk .
that when we actually don 't care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are nonetheless implicated .
we love innovation .
we love technology . we love creativity .
we love entertainment .
and for me , it becomes necessary to integrate the two .
because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hopeful , more committed , more dedicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
and for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the disadvantaged , those who will never get to ted .
but thinking about them in a way that is integrated in our own lives .
you know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven 't seen .
we do . as rational as we are , as committed to intellect as we are .
innovation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
they come from the ideas in our mind that are also fueled by some conviction in our heart .
he said , when we were in eastern europe and dealing with oppression , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an orientation of the spirit , a willingness to sometimes be in hopeless places and be a witness . 
well that orientation of the spirit is very much at the core of what i believe even ted communities have to be engaged in .
now i will warn you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don 't pay attention to this .
it will get to you .
i had the great privilege , when i was a young lawyer , of meeting rosa parks .
and these women would get together and just talk .
do you want to come over and listen ? 
and i 'd say , yes , ma 'am , i do . 
and she 'd say , well what are you going to do when you get here ? 
i said , i 'm going to listen . 
and i 'd go over there and i would , i would just listen .
and one time i was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours ms . parks turned to me and she said , now bryan , tell me what the equal justice initiative is .
tell me what you 're trying to do . 
and i began giving her my rap .
i said , well we 're trying to challenge injustice .
we 're trying to help people who have been wrongly convicted .
we 're trying to confront bias and discrimination in the administration of criminal justice .
we 're trying to do something about the death penalty .
we 're trying to reduce the prison population .
she said , that 's going to make you tired , tired , tired . 
and i actually believe that the ted community needs to be more courageous .
we need to find ways to embrace these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone 's humanity .
i 've learned very simple things doing the work that i do .
it 's just taught me very simple things .
that each of us is more than the worst thing we 've ever done .
i believe that for every person on the planet .
i think if somebody tells a lie , they 're not just a liar .
i think if somebody takes something that doesn 't belong to them , they 're not just a thief .
i think even if you kill someone , you 're not just a killer .
and because of that there 's this basic human dignity that must be respected by law .
i also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this globe , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
i don 't believe that .
i actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
and finally , i believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so stimulating , we will ultimately not be judged by our technology , we won 't be judged by our design , we won 't be judged by our intellect and reason .
ultimately , you judge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privileged , but by how they treat the poor , the condemned , the incarcerated .
i sometimes get out of balance . i 'll end with this story .
i sometimes push too hard .
i do get tired , as we all do .
sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
and i 've been representing these kids who have been sentenced to do these very harsh sentences .
and i go to the jail and i see my client who 's and , and he 's been certified to stand trial as an adult .
i start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
how can a judge turn you into something that you 're not ?
and the judge has certified him as an adult , but i see this kid .
you should ask for some of that .
and because i was up too late , wasn 't thinking real straight , i started working on a motion .
and i had a client who was years old , a young , poor black kid .
there was a crazy line in there about how there 's no conduct in this county , it 's all misconduct .
and the next morning , i woke up and i thought , now did i dream that crazy motion , or did i actually write it ?
and to my horror , not only had i written it , but i had sent it to court .
a couple months went by , and i had just forgotten all about it .
and i finally decided , oh gosh , i 've got to go to the court and do this crazy case .
and i got into my car and i was feeling really overwhelmed overwhelmed .
and i got in my car and i went to this courthouse .
and i was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so painful .
and i finally got out of the car and i started walking up to the courthouse .
when this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , who are you ? 
i said , i 'm a lawyer . he said , you 're a lawyer ? i said , yes , sir . 
and this man came over to me and he hugged me .
and he whispered in my ear .
he said , i 'm so proud of you . 
and i have to tell you , it was energizing .
it connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community , to a perspective that is hopeful .
well i went into the courtroom .
and as soon as i walked inside , the judge saw me coming in .
he said , mr . stevenson , did you write this crazy motion ? 
i said , yes , sir . i did . and we started arguing .
and people started coming in because they were just outraged .
i had written these crazy things .
and police officers were coming in and assistant prosecutors and clerk workers .
and before i knew it , the courtroom was filled with people angry that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about inequality .
and out of the corner of my eye , i could see this janitor pacing back and forth .
he kept pacing back and forth .
about minutes later the judge said we would take a break .
and during the break there was a deputy sheriff who was offended that the janitor had come into court .
and this deputy jumped up and he ran over to this older black man .
he said , jimmy , what are you doing in this courtroom ? 
and this older black man stood up and he looked at that deputy and he looked at me and he said , i came into this courtroom to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the prize , hold on . 
that we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dignity .
that all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone .
that our visions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with visions of humanity , compassion and justice .
and more than anything , for those of you who share that , i 've simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the prize , hold on .
so you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
other than writing a check , what could we do ?
well there are opportunities all around us .
for example , here in california we 're going to spend one billion dollars on the death penalty in the next five years one billion dollars .
and yet , percent of all homicide cases don 't result in arrest .
so there 's an opportunity to change that .
and this referendum would propose having those dollars go to law enforcement and safety .
and i think that opportunity exists all around us .
there 's been this huge decline in crime in america over the last three decades .
what would you say to someone who believed that ?
well actually the violent crime rate has remained relatively stable .
it was this misguided war on drugs .
that 's where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population .
i believe we need to do more to help people who are victimized by crime , not do less .
and i think that 's the orientation that we have to change .
bryan , you 've struck a massive chord here .
you 're an inspiring person .
thank you so much for coming to ted . thank you .
famine in somalia . police pepper spray .
societal decay . dead .
drug war . mass destruction . tornado .
crisis . death . disaster .
oh , my god .
so those are just a few of the clips i collected over the last six months could have easily been the last six days or the last six years .
the point is that the news media preferentially feeds us negative stories because that 's what our minds pay attention to .
and there 's a very good reason for that .
every second of every day , our senses bring in way too much data than we can possibly process in our brains .
and because nothing is more important to us than survival , the first stop of all of that data is an ancient sliver of the temporal lobe called the amygdala .
it sorts and scours through all of the information looking for anything in the environment that might harm us .
so given a dozen news stories , we will preferentially look at the negative news .
and that old newspaper saying , if it bleeds it leads , is very true .
so given all of our digital devices that are bringing all the negative news to us seven days a week , hours a day , it 's no wonder that we 're pessimistic .
it 's no wonder that people think that the world is getting worse .
but perhaps that 's not the case .
perhaps instead , of what 's really going on .
perhaps the tremendous progress we 've made over the last century by a series of forces are , in fact , accelerating to a point that we have the potential in the next three decades to create a world of abundance .
now i 'm not saying we don 't have our set of problems climate crisis , species extinction , water and energy shortage we surely do .
and as humans , we are far better at seeing the problems way in advance , but ultimately we knock them down .
so let 's look at what this last century has been to see where we 're going .
over the last hundred years , the average human lifespan has more than doubled , average per capita income adjusted for inflation around the world has tripled .
childhood mortality has come down a factor of .
steve pinker has showed us that , in fact , we 're living during the most peaceful time ever in human history .
we truly are living in an extraordinary time .
and many people forget this .
and we keep setting our expectations higher and higher .
in fact , we redefine what poverty means .
think of this , in america today , the majority of people under the poverty line still have electricity , water , toilets , refrigerators , television , mobile phones , air conditioning and cars .
that 's why the cellphone in your pocket is literally a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer of the ' s .
now look at this curve .
this is moore 's law over the last hundred years .
i want you to notice two things from this curve .
number one , how smooth it is through good time and bad time , war time and peace time , recession , depression and boom time .
this is the result of faster computers being used to build faster computers .
it doesn 't slow for any of our grand challenges .
and also , even though it 's plotted on a log curve on the left , it 's curving upwards .
the rate at which the technology is getting faster is itself getting faster .
and on this curve , riding on moore 's law , are a set of extraordinarily powerful technologies available to all of us .
cloud computing , what my friends at autodesk call infinite computing sensors and networks robotics d printing , which is the ability to democratize and distribute personalized production around the planet synthetic biology fuels , vaccines and foods digital medicine nanomaterials and a .i .
i mean , how many of you saw the winning of jeopardy by ibm 's watson ?
i mean , that was epic .
in fact , i scoured the headlines looking for the best headline in a newspaper i could .
jeopardy 's not an easy game .
it 's about the nuance of human language .
four years ago here at ted , ray kurzweil and i started a new university called singularity university .
and we teach our students all of these technologies , and particularly how they can be used to solve humanity 's grand challenges .
and every year we ask them to start a company or a product or a service that can affect positively the lives of a billion people within a decade .
think about that , the fact that , literally , a group of students can touch the lives of a billion people today .
 years ago that would have sounded ludicrous .
today we can point at dozens of companies that have done just that .
when i think about creating abundance , it 's not about creating a life of luxury for everybody on this planet it 's about creating a life of possibility .
it is about taking that which was scarce and making it abundant .
let me give you an example .
so this is a story of napoleon iii in the mid s .
he 's the dude on the left .
all of napoleon 's troops were fed with silver utensils , napoleon himself with gold utensils .
you see , aluminum was the most valuable metal on the planet , worth more than gold and platinum .
you see , even though aluminum is . percent of the earth by mass , it doesn 't come as a pure metal .
but then the technology of electrolysis came along and literally made aluminum so cheap that we use it with throw away mentality .
so let 's project this analogy going forward .
we think about energy scarcity .
ladies and gentlemen , we are on a planet that is bathed with , times more energy than we use in a year .
 terawatts of energy hits the earth 's surface every minutes .
it 's not about being scarce , it 's about accessibility .
and there 's good news here .
for the first time , this year the cost of solar generated electricity is percent that of diesel generated electricity in india . rupees versus rupees .
the cost of solar dropped percent last year .
and if we have abundant energy , we also have abundant water .
now we talk about water wars .
do you remember when carl sagan turned the voyager spacecraft back towards the earth , in after it just passed saturn ?
he took a famous photo . what was it called ?
we live on a planet percent covered by water .
yes , . percent is saltwater , two percent is ice , and we fight over a half a percent of the water on this planet , but here too there is hope .
and there is technology coming online , not , years from now , right now .
it 's able to generate a thousand liters of clean drinking water a day out of any source saltwater , polluted water , latrine at less than two cents a liter .
the chairman of coca cola has just agreed to do a major test of hundreds of units of this in the developing world .
and if that pans out , which i have every confidence it will , coca cola will deploy this globally to countries around the planet .
and we 've seen this in cellphones .
and if they 're on a smartphone on google , they 've got access to more knowledge and information than president clinton did years ago .
they 're living in a world of information and communication abundance that no one could have ever predicted .
probably the best part of it is what 's coming down the pike in health .
last month , i had the pleasure of announcing with qualcomm foundation something called the million qualcomm tricorder x prize .
so literally , imagine this device in the middle of the developing world where there are no doctors , percent of the disease burden and . percent of the health care workers .
when this device sequences an rna or dna virus that it doesn 't recognize , it calls the cdc and prevents the pandemic from happening in the first place .
but here , here is the biggest force for bringing about a world of abundance .
i call it the rising billion .
so the white lines here are population .
we just passed the seven billion mark on earth .
and by the way , the biggest protection against a population explosion is making the world educated and healthy .
in , we had just short of two billion people online , connected .
by , that 's going from two billion to five billion internet users .
three billion new minds who have never been heard from before are connecting to the global conversation .
what will these people want ?
what will they consume ? what will they desire ?
these people represent tens of trillions of dollars injected into the global economy .
what about giving the oppressed , wherever they might be , the voice to be heard and the voice to act for the first time ever ?
what will these three billion people bring ?
what about contributions we can 't even predict ?
the one thing i 've learned at the x prize is that small teams driven by their passion with a clear focus can do extraordinary things , things that large corporations and governments could only do in the past .
let me share and close with a story that really got me excited .
there is a program that some of you might have heard of .
it 's a game called foldit .
it came out of the university of washington in seattle .
and this is a game where individuals can actually take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how the protein is going to fold .
and how it folds dictates its structure and its functionality .
and up until now , it 's been a supercomputer problem .
and this game has been played by university professors and so forth .
and it 's literally , hundreds of thousands of people came online and started playing it .
and it showed that , in fact , today , the human pattern recognition machinery is better at folding proteins than the best computers .
ladies and gentlemen , what gives me tremendous confidence in the future is the fact that we are now more empowered as individuals to take on the grand challenges of this planet .
we have the tools with this exponential technology .
we have the passion of the diy innovator .
we have the capital of the techno philanthropist .
and we have three billion new minds coming online to work with us to solve the grand challenges , to do that which we must do .
we are living into extraordinary decades ahead .
thank you .
and i think it starts with one physician , and that 's me .
and maybe i 've been around long enough that i can afford to give away some of my false prestige to be able to do that .
before i actually begin the meat of my talk , let 's begin with a bit of baseball .
hey , why not ?
we 're near the end , we 're getting close to the world series .
we all love baseball , don 't we ?
baseball is filled with some amazing statistics .
and there 's hundreds of them .
 moneyball is about to come out , and it 's all about statistics and using statistics to build a great baseball team .
i 'm going to focus on one stat that i hope a lot of you have heard of .
it 's called batting average .
so we talk about a , a batter who bats .
that means that ballplayer batted safely , hit safely three times out of at bats .
three times out of .
do you know what they call a hitter in major league baseball ?
good , really good , maybe an all star .
do you know what they call a baseball hitter ?
that 's somebody who hit , by the way , four times safely out of every .
legendary as in ted williams legendary the last major league baseball player to hit over during a regular season .
now let 's take this back into my world of medicine where i 'm a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what i 'm going to talk to you about .
somehow this isn 't working out , is it ?
but , but , you know what ?
she 's doing a lot better this year . she 's on the comeback trail .
and she 's hitting a .
somehow this isn 't working .
but i 'm going to ask you a question .
 , , very good .
what we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the admonition , be perfect .
never ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that 's going to happen .
and that was the message that i absorbed when i was in med school .
in high school , a classmate once said that brian goldman would study for a blood test .
and so i did .
and i memorized everything .
and all the while , i was amassing more and more knowledge .
and i did well , i graduated with honors , cum laude .
and i came out of medical school with the impression that if i memorized everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would immunize me against making mistakes .
at the time i was assigned to the cardiology service on a cardiology rotation .
and to report back to my attending .
this is a condition in which the heart fails , and instead of being able to pump all the blood forward , some of the blood backs up into the lung , the lungs fill up with blood , and that 's why you have shortness of breath .
and that wasn 't a difficult diagnosis to make .
i made it and i set to work treating her .
i gave her aspirin . i gave her medications to relieve the strain on her heart .
and over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
and i felt really good .
and that 's when i made my first mistake i sent her home .
actually , i made two more mistakes .
i sent her home without speaking to my attending .
maybe i did it for a good reason .
maybe i didn 't want to be a high maintenance resident .
maybe i wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that i would do so and i would be able to take care of my attending 's patients without even having to contact him .
the second mistake that i made was worse .
i can remember that like it was yesterday .
and i went back to my work on the wards .
all the rest of that day , that afternoon , i had this kind of gnawing feeling inside my stomach .
but i carried on with my work .
and at the end of the day , i packed up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when i did something that i don 't usually do .
i walked through the emergency department on my way home .
the three words are do you remember ?
 do you remember that patient you sent home ? 
the other nurse asked matter of factly .
 well she 's back , in just that tone of voice .
well she was back all right .
she was back and near death .
and i was shocked and shaken to the core .
and over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
she had irreversible brain damage .
and the family gathered .
over the next few weeks , i beat myself up and i experienced for the first time the unhealthy shame that exists in our culture of medicine where i felt alone , isolated , not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel , because you can 't talk about it with your colleagues .
that 's the kind of shame that is a teacher .
the unhealthy shame i 'm talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
it 's the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
and it was what i was feeling .
and i kept asking myself these questions .
why didn 't i ask my attending ? why did i send her home ?
and then at my worst moments why did i make such a stupid mistake ?
why did i go into medicine ?
slowly but surely , it lifted .
i began to feel a bit better .
and on a cloudy day , there was a crack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and i wondered , maybe i could feel better again .
and they did .
and i went back to work .
and then it happened again .
it was busy , i was in a bit of a hurry .
he kept pointing here .
i looked at his throat , it was a little bit pink .
and i gave him a prescription for penicillin and sent him on his way .
and even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of pointing to his throat .
and she said the three words do you remember ?
 do you remember that patient you saw with the sore throat ? 
and fortunately he didn 't die .
now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but people a night .
now in both cases , i didn 't send them home and i don 't think there was any gap in their care .
the other one had a lot of diarrhea .
in both cases , they had their operations and they did okay .
and i 'd like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total b .s .
alone , ashamed and unsupported .
here 's the problem if i can 't come clean and talk about my mistakes , if i can 't find the still small voice that tells me what really happened , how can i share it with my colleagues ?
how can i teach them about what i did so that they don 't do the same thing ?
if i were to walk into a room like right now , i have no idea what you think of me .
when was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
oh yeah , you go to a cocktail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you 're not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
that 's the system that we have .
it 's a complete denial of mistakes .
it 's a system in which there are two kinds of physicians those who make mistakes and those who don 't , those who can 't handle sleep deprivation and those who can , those who have lousy outcomes and those who have great outcomes .
and it 's almost like an ideological reaction , like the antibodies begin to attack that person .
and we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
but there are two problems with that .
and what i 've learned is that errors are absolutely ubiquitous .
in the united states , the institute of medicine pegged it at , .
sleep deprivation is absolutely pervasive .
we can 't get rid of it .
we have our cognitive biases , so that i can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain .
i don 't take the same history .
i 'm not a robot i don 't do things the same way each time .
and my patients aren 't cars they don 't tell me their symptoms in the same way each time .
given all of that , mistakes are inevitable .
and their pupils would dilate , they would recoil , then they would look down and swallow hard and start to tell me their stories .
they want to tell their stories . they want to share their stories .
they want to be able to say , look , don 't make the same mistake i did . 
what they need is an environment to be able to do that .
what they need is a redefined medical culture .
and it starts with one physician at a time .
the redefined physician is human , knows she 's human , accepts it , isn 't proud of making mistakes , but strives to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
she shares her experience with others .
she 's supportive when other people talk about their mistakes .
and she works in a culture of medicine that acknowledges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
my name is brian goldman .
i am a redefined physician .
i 'm human . i make mistakes .
i 'm sorry about that , but i strive to learn one thing that i can pass on to other people .
i still don 't know what you think of me , but i can live with that .
and let me close with three words of my own i do remember .
i 'm going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
and because the idea can be explained in one minute , i will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
and the first story is about charles darwin , one of my heroes .
and he was here , as you well know , in ' .
and you 'd think he was chasing finches , but he wasn 't .
he was actually collecting fish .
and he described one of them as very common . 
this was the sailfin grouper .
a big fishery was run on it until the ' s .
now the fish is on the iucn red list .
now this story , we have heard it lots of times on galapagos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
but the point is , we still come to galapagos .
we still think it is pristine .
the brochures still say it is untouched .
so what happens here ?
because i was there in ' , studying a lagoon in west africa .
i was there because i grew up in europe and i wanted later to work in africa .
and i thought i could blend in .
and i got a big sunburn , and i was convinced that i was really not from there .
this was my first sunburn .
when i went there years later , the fish had shrunk to half of their size .
they were maturing at five centimeters .
they had been pushed genetically .
there were still fishes .
they were still kind of happy .
and the fish also were happy to be there .
so nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
my third little story is that i was an accomplice in the introduction of trawling in southeast asia .
and what we caught , we didn 't have words for it .
what we caught , i know now , is the bottom of the sea .
and percent of our catch were sponges , other animals that are fixed on the bottom .
and actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the debris , the piles of debris , were coral reef fish .
essentially the bottom of the sea came onto the deck and then was thrown down .
and these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rapid .
within a year , you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins .
this is a dead turtle .
they were not eaten , they were thrown away because they were dead .
and one time we caught a live one .
it was not drowned yet .
and then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
this mountain of debris is actually collected by fishers every time they go into an area that 's never been fished .
but it 's not documented .
we transform the world , but we don 't remember it .
if you generalize this , something like this happens .
and over time it changes it changes because people do things , or naturally .
every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will extrapolate forward .
and the difference then , they perceive as a loss .
but they don 't perceive what happened before as a loss .
you can have a succession of changes .
at the end you want to sustain miserable leftovers .
and that , to a large extent , is what we want to do now .
we want to sustain things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in predatory societies , they killed animals and they didn 't know they had done so after a few generations .
because , obviously , an animal that is very abundant , before it gets extinct , it becomes rare .
so you don 't lose abundant animals .
you always lose rare animals .
and therefore they 're not perceived as a big loss .
over time , we concentrate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish .
they become rarer because we fish them .
and the question is , why do people accept this ?
well because they don 't know that it was different .
and in fact , lots of people , scientists , will contest that it was really different .
and they will contest this because the evidence presented in an earlier mode is not in the way they would like the evidence presented .
so you have a situation where people don 't know the past , even though we live in literate societies , because they don 't trust the sources of the past .
and hence , the enormous role that a marine protected area can play .
because with marine protected areas , we actually recreate the past .
how about the people who can 't do that because they have no access the people in the midwest for example ?
there i think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and simulation .
this is a simulation of chesapeake bay .
there were gray whales in chesapeake bay a long time ago years ago .
and you will have noticed that the hues and tones are like avatar . 
because it evokes something that in a sense has been lost .
and so my recommendation , it 's the only one i will provide , is for cameron to do avatar ii underwater .
thank you very much .
in the s in the communist eastern germany , if you owned a typewriter , you had to register it with the government .
and this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
if they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
and we in the west couldn 't understand how anybody could do this , how much this would restrict freedom of speech .
we would never do that in our own countries .
this is happening to us today .
and nobody seems to be making a fuss about it .
and this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
and this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
if we take a look at what 's really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the attackers .
we have online criminals .
and the motives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
these guys make money .
they use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
this is alfred gonzalez .
this is stephen watt .
mr . jain himself is on the loose nobody knows where he is .
and i claim it 's already today that it 's more likely for any of us to become the victim of a crime online than here in the real world .
and it 's very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
in the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
they 're motivated by something else motivated by protests , motivated by an opinion , motivated by the laughs .
this is a prime example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
somebody broke in and they hacked it thoroughly .
and his answer was yes .
so how do people die as the result of a hack like this ?
they sell certificates .
except they can if they hack into a foreign c .a .
what about arab spring and things that have been happening , for example , in egypt ?
and within that binder were notes from a company based in germany which had sold the egyptian government a set of tools for intercepting and in very large scale all the communication of the citizens of the country .
they had sold this tool for , euros to the egyptian government .
so western governments are providing totalitarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
but western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
but today , it goes beyond that .
they will tap your internet connection .
now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn 't really affect me because i 'm a legal citizen .
why should i worry ?
because i have nothing to hide . 
and this is an argument , which doesn 't make sense .
privacy is implied .
privacy is not up for discussion .
this is not a question between privacy against security .
it 's a question of freedom against control .
and while we might trust our governments right now , right here in , any right we give away will be given away for good .
and do we trust , do we blindly trust , any future government , a government we might have years from now ?
and these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next years .
they enabled us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bridges , one brick at a time .
almost a hundred years later in , lego came up with this .
it was called the automatic binding brick .
and in a few short years , lego bricks took place in every household .
it 's estimated that over billion bricks have been produced or bricks for every person on the planet .
you don 't have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bridges , beautiful buildings .
lego made it accessible .
meanwhile the exact same year , at bell labs the next revolution was about to be announced , the next building block .
like the concrete block , the transistor allows you to build much larger , more complex circuits , one brick at a time .
i personally don 't accept this , that the building block of our time is reserved for experts , so i decided to change that .
eight years ago when i was at the media lab , i started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
let me show you how they work .
they 're pre engineered to be light , sound , motors and sensors .
and the best part about it is they snap together with magnets .
so you can 't put them the wrong way .
the bricks are color coded .
green is output , blue is power , pink is input and orange is wire .
you put a blue to a green , you can make light .
i 'm going to stop that .
so to make this blink faster or slower , you would just turn this knob and basically make it pulse faster or slower .
and it 's been an incredible experience .
the nicest thing is how they start to understand the electronics around them from everyday that they don 't learn at schools .
here 's an example of a project they made , a motion activated confetti canon ball .
but wait , this is actually my favorite project .
and we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
we want to encourage a world of creators , of inventors , of contributors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
so go ahead and start inventing .
thank you .
we 're all born . we all bring our children into the world .
we have to deal with the inexorable separation of death , so it shouldn 't surprise us that we all sing , we all dance , we all have art .
but what 's interesting is the unique cadence of the song , the rhythm of the dance in every culture .
and this is an idea , if you think about it , can only fill you with hope .
and the great indicator of that , of course , is language loss .
when each of you in this room were born , there were , languages spoken on the planet .
now , a language is not just a body of vocabulary or a set of grammatical rules .
a language is a flash of the human spirit .
it 's a vehicle through which the soul of each particular culture comes into the material world .
and of those , languages , as we sit here today in monterey , fully half are no longer being whispered into the ears of children .
they 're no longer being taught to babies , which means , effectively , unless something changes , they 're already dead .
what could be more lonely than to be enveloped in silence , to be the last of your people to speak your language , to have no way to pass on the wisdom of the ancestors or anticipate the promise of the children ?
and yet , that dreadful fate is indeed the plight of somebody somewhere on earth roughly every two weeks , because every two weeks , some elder dies and carries with him into the grave the last syllables of an ancient tongue .
let 's make it kogi . 
and you 'll suddenly discover what it would be like to be unable to speak your own language .
now , there are many of us who sort of forget that when i say different ways of being , i really do mean different ways of being .
they simply listen and then begin to speak .
in , five missionaries attempted contact and made a critical mistake .
they dropped from the air x glossy photographs of themselves in what we would say to be friendly gestures , forgetting that these people of the rainforest had never seen anything two dimensional in their lives .
their hunters could smell animal urine at paces and tell you what species left it behind .
on the contrary , it 's a complex metaphysical worldview .
it 's interesting .
if i asked you to name the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
but , what makes voodoo so interesting is that it 's this living relationship between the living and the dead .
so , the living give birth to the spirits .
we dance in the temple and become god . 
and because you are possessed , you are taken by the spirit how can you be harmed ?
to this day , they remain ruled by a ritual priesthood but the training for the priesthood is rather extraordinary .
it is that beautiful . it is yours to protect . 
they call themselves the elder brothers and they say we , who are the younger brothers , are the ones responsible for destroying the world .
now , this level of intuition becomes very important .
well , indigenous people are neither sentimental nor weakened by nostalgia .
now , what does that mean ?
it means that a young kid from the andes who 's raised to believe that that mountain is an apu spirit that will direct his or her destiny will be a profoundly different human being and have a different relationship to that resource or that place than a young kid from montana raised to believe that a mountain is a pile of rock ready to be mined .
whether it 's the abode of a spirit or a pile of ore is irrelevant .
what 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
now , if you begin to look at the idea that these cultures could create different realities , you could begin to understand some of their extraordinary discoveries . take this plant here .
it 's a photograph i took in the northwest amazon just last april .
this is ayahuasca , which many of you have heard about , the most powerful psychoactive preparation of the shaman 's repertoire .
it doesn 't create the distortion of reality it creates the dissolution of reality .
well , we use that great euphemism , trial and error , which is exposed to be meaningless .
but you ask the indians , and they say , the plants talk to us . 
well , what does that mean ?
and then you ask them how they establish their taxonomy and they say , i thought you knew something about plants .
i mean , don 't you know anything ? and i said , no . 
well , it turns out you take each of the varieties in the night of a full moon , and it sings to you in a different key .
well , the truth is the th century , years from now , is not going to be remembered for its wars or its technological innovations , but rather as the era in which we stood by and either actively endorsed or passively accepted the massive destruction of both biological and cultural diversity on the planet . now , the problem isn 't change .
and the problem is not technology itself .
or if we go into the mountains of tibet , where i 'm doing a lot of research recently , you 'll see it 's a crude face of political domination .
and you cannot understand the pain of tibet until you move through it at the ground level .
that meant he was instantly killed at the time of the chinese invasion .
his uncle fled with his holiness in the diaspora that took the people to nepal .
his mother was incarcerated for the crime of being wealthy .
and it 's humbling to remember that our species has , perhaps , been around for , years .
the modern industrial world as we know it is barely years old .
now , that shallow history doesn 't suggest to me that we have all the answers for all of the challenges that will confront us in the ensuing millennia .
the canadian government has not always been kind to the inuit people , and during the s , to establish our sovereignty , we forced them into settlements .
this old man 's grandfather refused to go .
the family , fearful for his life , took away all of his weapons , all of his tools .
now , you must understand that the inuit did not fear the cold they took advantage of it .
so , this man 's grandfather was not intimidated by the arctic night or the blizzard that was blowing .
talk about getting by with nothing .
and this , in many ways is a symbol of the resilience of the inuit people and of all indigenous people around the world .
the canadian government in april of gave back to total control of the inuit an area of land larger than california and texas put together .
an amazing example of how a nation state can seek restitution with its people .
and finally , in the end , i think it 's pretty obvious at least to all of all us who 've traveled in these remote reaches of the planet , to realize that they 're not remote at all .
they 're homelands of somebody .
they represent branches of the human imagination that go back to the dawn of time . and for all of us , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of our own children , become part of the naked geography of hope .
so , what we 're trying to do at the national geographic , finally , is , we believe that politicians will never accomplish anything .
 nations carry our television channel .
our magazines are read by millions .
thank you very much .
what i 'm going to show you first , as quickly as i can , is some foundational work , some new technology that we brought to microsoft as part of an acquisition almost exactly a year ago . this is seadragon , and it 's an environment in which you can either locally or remotely interact with vast amounts of visual data .
and it doesn 't matter how much information we 're looking at , how big these collections are or how big the images are .
it doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that ought to limit the performance of a system like this one is the number of pixels on your screen at any given moment . it 's also very flexible architecture .
maybe this is a kind of an artificial way to read an e book .
i wouldn 't recommend it .
every large image is the beginning of a section .
we 've also done a little something with the corner of this particular issue of the guardian .
we 've made up a fake ad that 's very high resolution much higher than you 'd be able to get in an ordinary ad and we 've embedded extra content .
if you want to see the features of this car , you can see it here .
or other models , or even technical specifications .
and this really gets at some of these ideas about really doing away with those limits on screen real estate .
we hope that this means no more pop ups and other kind of rubbish like that shouldn 't be necessary .
of course , mapping is one of those really obvious applications for a technology like this .
and this one i really won 't spend any time on , except to say that we have things to contribute to this field as well .
but those are all the roads in the u .s .
so let 's pull up , now , something else .
this is actually live on the web now you can go check it out .
this is a project called photosynth , which really marries two different technologies .
and so this is live on the web . it 's powered by seadragon .
you can see that when we kind of do these sorts of views , where we can dive through images and have this kind of multi resolution experience .
but the spatial arrangement of the images here is actually meaningful .
i 'm not sure if i have time to show you any other environments .
there are some that are much more spatial .
i would like to jump straight to one of noah 's original data sets and this is from an early prototype of photosynth that we first got working in the summer to show you what i think is really the punch line behind this technology , the photosynth technology . and it 's not necessarily so apparent from looking at the environments that we 've put up on the website .
we had to worry about the lawyers and so on .
and so these are all flickr images , and they 've all been related spatially in this way .
and we can just navigate in this very simple way .
you know , i never thought that i 'd end up working at microsoft .
it 's very gratifying to have this kind of reception here .
and if i can , i 'll find some of the sort of weird ones .
so many of them are occluded by faces , and so on .
somewhere in here there are actually a series of photographs here we go .
this is actually a poster of notre dame that registered correctly .
we can dive in from the poster to a physical view of this environment .
what the point here really is is that we can do things with the social environment . this is now taking data from everybody from the entire collective memory of , visually , of what the earth looks like and link all of that together .
all of those photos become linked together , and they make something emergent that 's greater than the sum of the parts .
you have a model that emerges of the entire earth .
and this is something that grows in complexity as people use it , and whose benefits become greater to the users as they use it .
thank you so much .
do i understand this right ? that what your software is going to allow , is that at some point , really within the next few years , all the pictures that are shared by anyone across the world are going to basically link together ?
yes . what this is really doing is discovering .
it 's creating hyperlinks , if you will , between images .
and it 's doing that based on the content inside the images .
and that gets really exciting when you think about the richness of the semantic information that a lot of those images have .
now , what if that picture links to all of your pictures ?
blaise , that is truly incredible . congratulations .
thanks so much .
i 'm going to talk to you about some stuff that 's in this book of mine that i hope will resonate with other things you 've already heard , and i 'll try to make some connections myself , in case you miss them .
i want to start with what i call the official dogma . 
the official dogma of what ?
the reason for this is both that freedom is in and of itself good , valuable , worthwhile , essential to being human .
and because if people have freedom , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will maximize our welfare , and no one has to decide on our behalf .
the way to maximize freedom is to maximize choice .
the more choice people have , the more freedom they have , and the more freedom they have , the more welfare they have .
this , i think , is so deeply embedded in the water supply that it wouldn 't occur to anyone to question it .
and it 's also deeply embedded in our lives .
i 'll give you some examples of what modern progress has made possible for us .
this is my supermarket . not such a big one .
so this is what the supermarket is like .
and then you go to the consumer electronics store to set up a stereo system speakers , cd player , tape player , tuner , amplifier and in this one single consumer electronics store , there are that many stereo systems .
we can construct six and a half million different stereo systems out of the components that are on offer in one store .
you 've got to admit that 's a lot of choice .
in other domains the world of communications .
there was a time , when i was a boy , when you could get any kind of telephone service you wanted , as long as it came from ma bell .
you rented your phone . you didn 't buy it .
one consequence of that , by the way , is that the phone never broke .
and those days are gone .
we now have an almost unlimited variety of phones , especially in the world of cell phones .
these are cell phones of the future .
and if by some chance you haven 't seen that in your store yet , you can rest assured that one day soon you will .
and what this does is it leads people to walk into their stores asking this question .
and do you know what the answer to this question now is ?
the answer is no . 
it is not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
so , in other aspects of life that are much more significant than buying things , the same explosion of choice is true .
health care it is no longer the case in the united states that you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you what to do .
instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor tells you , well , we could do a , or we could do b .
a has these benefits , and these risks .
b has these benefits , and these risks . what do you want to do ? 
and you say , doc , what should i do ? 
and the doc says , a has these benefits and risks , and b has these benefits and risks .
what do you want to do ? 
and you say , if you were me , doc , what would you do ? 
and the doc says , but i 'm not you . 
and the result is we call it patient autonomy , which makes it sound like a good thing , but what it really is is a shifting of the burden and the responsibility for decision making from somebody who knows something namely , the doctor to somebody who knows nothing and is almost certainly sick and thus not in the best shape to be making decisions namely , the patient .
there 's enormous marketing of prescription drugs to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , makes no sense at all , since we can 't buy them .
why do they market to us if we can 't buy them ?
the answer is that they expect us to call our doctors the next morning and ask for our prescriptions to be changed .
something as dramatic as our identity has now become a matter of choice , as this slide is meant to indicate .
we don 't inherit an identity we get to invent it .
and we get to re invent ourselves as often as we like .
and that means that everyday , when you wake up in the morning , you have to decide what kind of person you want to be .
with respect to marriage and family , there was a time when the default assumption that almost everyone had is that you got married as soon as you could , and then you started having kids as soon as you could .
the only real choice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
nowadays , everything is very much up for grabs .
i teach wonderfully intelligent students , and i assign percent less work than i used to .
and it 's not because they 're less smart , and it 's not because they 're less diligent .
it 's because they are preoccupied , asking themselves , should i get married or not ? should i get married now ?
should i get married later ? should i have kids first , or a career first ? 
all of these are consuming questions .
and they 're going to answer these questions , whether or not it means not doing all the work i assign and not getting a good grade in my courses .
and indeed they should . these are important questions to answer .
work we are blessed , as carl was pointing out , with the technology that enables us to work every minute of every day from any place on the planet except the randolph hotel .
i 'm not telling you about it because i want to use it .
so what this means , this incredible freedom of choice we have with respect to work , is that we have to make a decision , again and again and again , about whether we should or shouldn 't be working .
we can go to watch our kid play soccer , and we have our cell phone on one hip , and our blackberry on our other hip , and our laptop , presumably , on our laps .
and even if they 're all shut off , every minute that we 're watching our kid mutilate a soccer game , we are also asking ourselves , should i answer this cell phone call ?
should i respond to this email ? should i draft this letter ? 
so everywhere we look , big things and small things , material things and lifestyle things , life is a matter of choice .
and the world we used to live in looked like this .
that is to say , there were some choices , but not everything was a matter of choice .
and the world we now live in looks like this .
and the question is , is this good news , or bad news ?
and the answer is yes .
we all know what 's good about it , so i 'm going to talk about what 's bad about it .
all of this choice has two effects , two negative effects on people .
with so many options to choose from , people find it very difficult to choose at all .
i 'll give you one very dramatic example of this a study that was done of investments in voluntary retirement plans .
and then tomorrow , and then tomorrow , and tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course tomorrow never comes .
by not participating , they are passing up as much as , dollars a year from the employer , who would happily match their contribution .
so paralysis is a consequence of having too many choices .
and i think it makes the world look like this .
you really want to get the decision right if it 's for all eternity , right ?
so that 's one effect . the second effect is that even if we manage to overcome the paralysis and make a choice , we end up less satisfied with the result of the choice than we would be if we had fewer options to choose from .
and there are several reasons for this .
the more options there are , the easier it is to regret anything at all that is disappointing about the option that you chose .
dan gilbert made a big point this morning of talking about how much the way in which we value things depends on what we compare them to .
well , when there are lots of alternatives to consider , it is easy to imagine the attractive features of alternatives that you reject , that make you less satisfied with the alternative that you 've chosen .
here 's an example . for those of you who aren 't new yorkers , i apologize .
but here 's what you 're supposed to be thinking .
here 's this couple on the hamptons .
very expensive real estate .
gorgeous beach . beautiful day . they have it all to themselves .
what could be better ? well , damn it , this guy is thinking , it 's august .
i could be parking right in front of my building . 
here 's another example .
now this cartoon makes a lot of points .
it makes points about living in the moment as well , and probably about doing things slowly .
but one point it makes is that whenever you 're choosing one thing , you 're choosing not to do other things .
and those other things may have lots of attractive features , and it 's going to make what you 're doing less attractive .
third escalation of expectations .
this hit me when i went to replace my jeans .
i wear jeans almost all the time .
do you want them distressed ?
my jaw dropped , and after i recovered , i said , i want the kind that used to be the only kind . 
he had no idea what that was , so i spent an hour trying on all these damn jeans , and i walked out of the store truth ! with the best fitting jeans i had ever had .
i did better . all this choice made it possible for me to do better .
but i felt worse .
why ? i wrote a whole book to try to explain this to myself .
the reason i felt worse is that , with all of these options available , my expectations about how good a pair of jeans should be went up .
i had very low i had no particular expectations when they only came in one flavor .
when they came in flavors , damn it , one of them should 've been perfect .
and what i got was good , but it wasn 't perfect .
and so i compared what i got to what i expected , and what i got was disappointing in comparison to what i expected .
adding options to people 's lives can 't help but increase the expectations people have about how good those options will be .
and what that 's going to produce is less satisfaction with results , even when they 're good results .
nobody in the world of marketing knows this , because if they did , you wouldn 't all know what this was about .
the truth is more like this .
the reason that everything was better back when everything was worse is that when everything was worse , it was actually possible for people to have experiences that were a pleasant surprise .
nowadays , the world we live in we affluent , industrialized citizens , with perfection the expectation the best you can ever hope for is that stuff is as good as you expect it to be .
you will never be pleasantly surprised because your expectations , my expectations , have gone through the roof .
the secret to happiness this is what you all came for the secret to happiness is low expectations .
i couldn 't have done better . i didn 't settle .
but settling isn 't always such a bad thing .
finally , one consequence of buying a bad fitting pair of jeans when there is only one kind to buy is that when you are dissatisfied , and you ask why , who 's responsible , the answer is clear the world is responsible . what could you do ?
when there are hundreds of different styles of jeans available , and you buy one that is disappointing , and you ask why , who 's responsible ?
it is equally clear that the answer to the question is you .
you could have done better .
with a hundred different kinds of jeans on display , there is no excuse for failure .
and so when people make decisions , and even though the results of the decisions are good , they feel disappointed about them they blame themselves .
clinical depression has exploded in the industrial world in the last generation .
so let me remind you .
this is the official dogma , the one that we all take to be true , and it 's all false . it is not true .
there 's no question that some choice is better than none , but it doesn 't follow from that that more choice is better than some choice .
there 's some magical amount . i don 't know what it is .
i 'm pretty confident that we have long since passed the point where options improve our welfare .
now , as a policy matter i 'm almost done as a policy matter , the thing to think about is this what enables all of this choice in industrial societies is material affluence .
there are lots of places in the world , and we have heard about several of them , where their problem is not that they have too much choice .
their problem is that they have too little .
so the stuff i 'm talking about is the peculiar problem of modern , affluent , western societies .
what i 'm telling you is that these expensive , complicated choices it 's not simply that they don 't help .
they actually hurt .
they actually make us worse off .
if some of what enables people in our societies to make all of the choices we make were shifted to societies in which people have too few options , not only would those people 's lives be improved , but ours would be improved also .
so to conclude . you 're supposed to read this cartoon , and , being a sophisticated person , say , ah ! what does this fish know ?
impoverished imagination , a myopic view of the world and that 's the way i read it at first .
the more i thought about it , however , the more i came to the view that this fish knows something .
you increase paralysis , and you decrease satisfaction .
this one is almost certainly too limited perhaps even for the fish , certainly for us .
thank you very much .
you know , i 've talked about some of these projects before about the human genome and what that might mean , and discovering new sets of genes .
we 're actually starting at a new point we 've been digitizing biology , and now we 're trying to go from that digital code into a new phase of biology with designing and synthesizing life .
so , we 've always been trying to ask big questions .
 what is life ? is something that i think many biologists have been trying to understand at various levels .
we 've been digitizing it now for almost years when we sequenced the human genome , it was going from the analog world of biology into the digital world of the computer .
now we 're trying to ask , can we regenerate life or can we create new life out of this digital universe ? 
we 're able to knock out on the order of genes out of the or so that are here .
when we look at its metabolic map , it 's relatively simple compared to ours trust me , this is simple but when we look at all the genes that we can knock out one at a time , it 's very unlikely that this would yield a living cell .
so we decided the only way forward was to actually synthesize this chromosome so we could vary the components to ask some of these most fundamental questions .
and so we started down the road of can we synthesize a chromosome ?
can chemistry permit making these really large molecules where we 've never been before ?
and if we do , can we boot up a chromosome ?
so , our pace of digitizing life has been increasing at an exponential pace .
our ability to write the genetic code has been moving pretty slowly but has been increasing , and our latest point would put it on , now , an exponential curve .
we started this over years ago .
but it turns out synthesizing dna is very difficult .
there are tens of thousands of machines around the world that make small pieces of dna to letters in length and it 's a degenerate process , so the longer you make the piece , the more errors there are .
so we had to create a new method for putting these little pieces together and correct all the errors .
and this was our first attempt , starting with the digital information of the genome of phi x .
it 's a small virus that kills bacteria .
we designed the pieces , went through our error correction and had a dna molecule of about , letters .
the viral particles then were released from the cells and came back and killed the e . coli .
i was talking to the oil industry recently and i said they clearly understood that model .
they laughed more than you guys are .
and so , we think this is a situation where the software can actually build its own hardware in a biological system .
design is critical , and if you 're starting with digital information in the computer , that digital information has to be really accurate .
when we first sequenced this genome in , the standard of accuracy was one error per , base pairs .
part of the design is designing pieces that are letters long that have to overlap with all the other letter pieces to build smaller subunits we have to design so they can go together .
we design unique elements into this .
think of this we have a four letter genetic code a , c , g and t .
so we can use the genetic code to write out words , sentences , thoughts .
initially , all we did was autograph it .
some people were disappointed there was not poetry .
we designed these pieces so we can just chew back with enzymes there are enzymes that repair them and put them together .
and we started making pieces , starting with pieces that were , to , letters , put those together to make , letter pieces , then put sets of those going up to , .
at each stage , we grew up these pieces in abundance so we could sequence them because we 're trying to create a process that 's extremely robust that you can see in a minute .
we 're trying to get to the point of automation .
here 's an example of it there 's an organism called deinococcus radiodurans that can take three millions rads of radiation .
you can see in the top panel , its chromosome just gets blown apart .
twelve to hours later , it put it back together exactly as it was before .
we have thousands of organisms that can do this .
in fact , nasa has shown a lot of this is out there .
these are pictures over about a six second period .
so , this is the publication we had just a short while ago .
this is over , letters of genetic code it 's the largest molecule ever made by humans of a defined structure .
well , how do we boot up a chromosome ? how do we activate this ?
obviously , with a virus it 's pretty simple it 's much more complicated dealing with bacteria .
the new chromosome went into the cell .
in fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tried to design the process a little bit further .
so , people who think of evolution as just one gene changing at a time have missed much of biology .
there are enzymes called restriction enzymes that actually digest dna .
the chromosome that was in the cell doesn 't have one the chromosome we put in does .
it turned blue because of the genes we put in it .
and with a very short period of time , all the characteristics of one species were lost and it converted totally into the new species based on the new software that we put in the cell .
all the proteins changed , the membranes changed when we read the genetic code , it 's exactly what we had transferred in .
now i 've argued , this is not genesis this is building on three and a half billion years of evolution .
why do this ?
i think this is pretty obvious in terms of some of the needs .
to put it in context for myself i was born in .
there are now three people on the planet for every one of us that existed in within years , there 'll be four .
we have trouble feeding , providing fresh , clean water , medicines , fuel for the six and a half billion .
it 's going to be a stretch to do it for nine .
we use over five billion tons of coal , billion plus barrels of oil that 's a hundred million barrels a day .
when we try to think of biological processes or any process to replace that , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
then of course , there 's all that co from this material that ends up in the atmosphere .
we now , from our discovery around the world , have a database with about million genes , and i like to think of these as the design components of the future .
we 're limited here primarily by a biological reality and our imagination .
we have the ability now to build a large robot that can make a million chromosomes a day .
when you think of processing these million different genes or trying to optimize processes to produce octane or to produce pharmaceuticals , new vaccines , we can just with a small team , do more molecular biology than the last years of all science .
this is a screen snapshot of some true design software that we 're working on to actually be able to sit down and design species in the computer .
you know , we don 't know necessarily what it 'll look like we know exactly what their genetic code looks like .
we 're focusing on now fourth generation fuels .
you 've seen recently , corn to ethanol is just a bad experiment .
but the only way we think that biology can have a major impact without further increasing the cost of food and limiting its availability is if we start with co as its feedstock , and so we 're working with designing cells to go down this road .
sunlight and co is one method . . .
but in our discovery around the world , we have all kinds of other methods .
this is an organism we described in .
it lives in the deep ocean , about a mile and a half deep , almost at boiling water temperatures .
it takes co to methane using molecular hydrogen as its energy source .
so , in a short period of time , we think that we might be able to increase what the basic question is of what is life ? 
we truly , you know , have modest goals of replacing the whole petrol chemical industry yeah . if you can 't do that at ted , where can you ? become a major source of energy . . .
but also , we 're now working on using these same tools to come up with instant sets of vaccines .
you 've seen this year with flu we 're always a year behind and a dollar short when it comes to the right vaccine .
we 're a ways away from improving people our goal is just to make sure that we have a chance to survive long enough to maybe do that . thank you very much .
last year at ted i gave an introduction to the lhc .
and i promised to come back and give you an update on how that machine worked .
so this is it . and for those of you that weren 't there , the lhc is the largest scientific experiment ever attempted kilometers in circumference .
its job is to recreate the conditions that were present less than a billionth of a second after the universe began , up to million times a second .
it 's nothing if not ambitious .
this is the machine below geneva .
we take the pictures of those mini big bangs inside detectors .
this is the one i work on . it 's called the atlas detector meters wide , meters in diameter .
spectacular picture here of atlas under construction so you can see the scale .
on the th of september last year we turned the machine on for the first time .
and this picture was taken by atlas .
it caused immense celebration in the control room .
in other words , when we saw that picture on september th we knew the machine worked , which is a great triumph .
i don 't know whether this got the biggest cheer , or this , when someone went onto google and saw the front page was like that .
it means we made cultural impact as well as scientific impact .
about a week later we had a problem with the machine , related actually to these bits of wire here these gold wires .
now the engineers amongst you will look at them and say , no they don 't . they 're small wires . 
they can do that because when they are very cold they are what 's called superconducting wire .
so at minus degrees , colder than the space between the stars , those wires can take that current .
this was the result .
now that 's more impressive when you consider those magnets weigh over tons , and they moved about a foot .
so we damaged about of the magnets .
we had to take them out , which we did .
we reconditioned them all , fixed them .
they 're all on their way back underground now .
by the end of march the lhc will be intact again .
we will switch it on , and we expect to take data in june or july , and continue with our quest to find out what the building blocks of the universe are .
now of course , in a way those accidents reignite the debate about the value of science and engineering at the edge . it 's easy to refute .
thank you .
i am a writer .
writing books is my profession but it 's more than that , of course .
it is also my great lifelong love and fascination .
and i don 't expect that that 's ever going to change .
but , that said , something kind of peculiar has happened recently in my life and in my career , which has caused me to have to recalibrate my whole relationship with this work .
and the peculiar thing is that i recently wrote this book , this memoir called eat , pray , love which , decidedly unlike any of my previous books , went out in the world for some reason , and became this big , mega sensation , international bestseller thing .
like , they come up to me now , all worried , and they say , aren 't you afraid aren 't you afraid you 're never going to be able to top that ?
aren 't you afraid you 're going to keep writing for your whole life and you 're never again going to create a book that anybody in the world cares about at all , ever again ? 
so that 's reassuring , you know .
and people would say , aren 't you afraid you 're never going to have any success ?
aren 't you afraid the humiliation of rejection will kill you ?
like that , you know .
the answer the short answer to all those questions is , yes . 
yes , i 'm afraid of all those things .
and i always have been .
and i 'm afraid of many , many more things besides that people can 't even guess at .
like seaweed , and other things that are scary .
but , when it comes to writing , the thing that i 've been sort of thinking about lately , and wondering about lately , is why ?
you know , is it rational ?
is it logical that anybody should be expected to be afraid of the work that they feel they were put on this earth to do .
you know , and what is it specifically about creative ventures that seems to make us really nervous about each other 's mental health in a way that other careers kind of don 't do , you know ?
like my dad , for example , was a chemical engineer and i don 't recall once in his years of chemical engineering anybody asking him if he was afraid to be a chemical engineer , you know ?
it didn 't that chemical engineering block john , how 's it going ?
it just didn 't come up like that , you know ?
we writers , we kind of do have that reputation , and not just writers , but creative people across all genres , it seems , have this reputation for being enormously mentally unstable .
and even the ones who didn 't literally commit suicide seem to be really undone by their gifts , you know .
an extraordinary statement to make about your life 's work , you know .
and the question that i want to ask everybody here today is are you guys all cool with that idea ?
are you comfortable with that because you look at it even from an inch away and , you know i 'm not at all comfortable with that assumption .
i think it 's odious .
and i also think it 's dangerous , and i don 't want to see it perpetuated into the next century .
i think it 's better if we encourage our great creative minds to live .
which is you know , like check it out , i 'm pretty young , i 'm only about years old .
i should just put it bluntly , because we 're all sort of friends here now it 's exceedingly likely that my greatest success is behind me .
oh , so jesus , what a thought !
you know that 's the kind of thought that could lead a person to start drinking gin at nine o 'clock in the morning , and i don 't want to go there .
i would prefer to keep doing this work that i love .
and so , the question becomes , how ?
i have to sort of find some way to have a safe distance between me , as i am writing , and my very natural anxiety about what the reaction to that writing is going to be , from now on .
and that search has led me to ancient greece and ancient rome .
so stay with me , because it does circle around and back .
but , ancient greece and ancient rome people did not happen to believe that creativity came from human beings back then , o .k . ?
people believed that creativity was this divine attendant spirit that came to human beings from some distant and unknowable source , for distant and unknowable reasons .
which is great , because the romans did not actually think that a genius was a particularly clever individual .
so brilliant there it is , right there , that distance that i 'm talking about that psychological construct to protect you from the results of your work .
and everyone knew that this is how it functioned , right ?
if your work was brilliant you couldn 't take all the credit for it , everybody knew that you had this disembodied genius who had helped you .
everyone knew your genius was kind of lame .
and this is how people thought about creativity in the west for a really long time .
and it 's the beginning of rational humanism , and people started to believe that creativity came completely from the self of the individual .
and for the first time in history , you start to hear people referring to this or that artist as being a genius rather than having a genius .
and i got to tell you , i think that was a huge error .
it 's like asking somebody to swallow the sun .
it just completely warps and distorts egos , and it creates all these unmanageable expectations about performance .
and i think the pressure of that has been killing off our artists for the last years .
and , if this is true , and i think it is true , the question becomes , what now ?
can we do this differently ?
maybe go back to some more ancient understanding about the relationship between humans and the creative mystery .
maybe not .
maybe we can 't just erase years of rational humanistic thought in one minute speech .
i 'm not , probably , going to bring you all along with me on this .
but the question that i kind of want to pose is you know , why not ?
why not think about it this way ?
a process which , as anybody who has ever tried to make something which is to say basically everyone here knows does not always behave rationally .
and she felt it coming , because it would shake the earth under her feet .
she knew that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her words , run like hell . 
and other times she wouldn 't be fast enough , so she 'd be running and running and running , and she wouldn 't get to the house and the poem would barrel through her and she would miss it and she said it would continue on across the landscape , looking , as she put it for another poet . 
and then there were these times this is the piece i never forgot she said that there were moments where she would almost miss it , right ?
so , she 's running to the house and she 's looking for the paper and the poem passes through her , and she grabs a pencil just as it 's going through her , and then she said , it was like she would reach out with her other hand and she would catch it .
and in these instances , the poem would come up on the page perfect and intact but backwards , from the last word to the first .
so when i heard that i was like that 's uncanny , that 's exactly what my creative process is like .
that 's not at all what my creative process is i 'm not the pipeline !
and i would imagine that a lot of you have too .
and what is that thing ?
and how are we to relate to it in a way that will not make us lose our minds , but , in fact , might actually keep us sane ?
but then he got older , he got calmer , and one day he was driving down the freeway in los angeles he told me , and this is when it all changed for him .
he doesn 't have a piece of paper , he doesn 't have a pencil , he doesn 't have a tape recorder .
so he starts to feel all of that old anxiety start to rise in him like , i 'm going to lose this thing , and then i 'm going to be haunted by this song forever .
i 'm not good enough , and i can 't do it . 
and instead of panicking , he just stopped .
he just stopped that whole mental process and he did something completely novel .
he just looked up at the sky , and he said , excuse me , can you not see that i 'm driving ? 
 do i look like i can write down a song right now ?
if you really want to exist , come back at a more opportune moment when i can take care of you .
and his whole work process changed after that .
not the work , the work was still oftentimes as dark as ever .
but the process , and the heavy anxiety around it was released when he took the genie , the genius out of him where it was causing nothing but trouble , and released it kind of back where it came from , and realized that this didn 't have to be this internalized , tormented thing .
it could be this peculiar , wondrous , bizarre collaboration kind of conversation between tom and the strange , external thing that was not quite tom .
so when i heard that story it started to shift a little bit the way that i worked too , and it already saved me once .
not just bad , but the worst book ever written .
but then i remembered tom talking to the open air and i tried it .
so i just lifted my face up from the manuscript and i directed my comments to an empty corner of the room .
and i said aloud , listen you , thing , you and i both know that if this book isn 't brilliant that is not entirely my fault , right ?
because you can see that i am putting everything i have into this , i don 't have any more than this .
so if you want it to be better , then you 've got to show up and do your part of the deal .
o .k . but if you don 't do that , you know what , the hell with it .
i 'm going to keep writing anyway because that 's my job .
and i would please like the record to reflect today that i showed up for my part of the job . 
and they were always magnificent , because the dancers were professionals and they were terrific , right ?
but every once in a while , very rarely , something would happen , and one of these performers would actually become transcendent .
and i know you know what i 'm talking about , because i know you 've all seen , at some point in your life , a performance like this .
and all of a sudden , he would no longer appear to be merely human .
he would be lit from within , and lit from below and all lit up on fire with divinity .
and when this happened , back then , people knew it for what it was , you know , they called it by its name .
they would put their hands together and they would start to chant , allah , allah , allah , god , god , god . 
that 's god , you know .
which is great , because we need that .
he 's just an aging mortal with really bad knees , and maybe he 's never going to ascend to that height again .
and maybe nobody will ever chant god 's name again as he spins , and what is he then to do with the rest of his life ?
this is hard .
but maybe it doesn 't have to be quite so full of anguish if you never happened to believe , in the first place , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being came from you .
and , you know , if we think about it this way it starts to change everything .
and what i have to , sort of keep telling myself when i get really psyched out about that , is , don 't be afraid .
don 't be daunted .
just do your job .
continue to show up for your piece of it , whatever that might be .
if your job is to dance , do your dance .
and if not , do your dance anyhow .
i believe this and i feel that we must teach it .
thank you .
thank you .
it expands in winter and contracts in summer .
as you see , it expands to the dark blue that 's the annual ice in winter , and it contracts in summer .
in years it 's gone from this , to this .
already in some shallow lakes in alaska , methane is actively bubbling up out of the water .
whoa !
she 's okay . the question is whether we will be .
and one reason is , this enormous heat sink heats up greenland from the north .
but the volumes are much larger than ever .
these flows are increasing very rapidly .
at the other end of the planet , antarctica the largest mass of ice on the planet .
that 's equal to feet of sea level , as is greenland .
in the andes , this glacier is the source of drinking water for this city .
the flows have increased .
but when they go away , so does much of the drinking water .
and the predictions , as you 've read , are serious .
four times as many in the last years as in the previous .
if you look at in the context of history you can see what this is doing .
in the last five years we 've added million tons of co every hours million tons every day to the oceans .
the biggest single cause of global warming , along with deforestation , which is percent of it , is the burning of fossil fuels .
oil is a problem , and coal is the most serious problem .
but we 're beginning to see a sea change .
here are the ones that have been cancelled in the last few years with some green alternatives proposed .
however there is a political battle in our country .
that image reminded me of something .
you probably saw it on the news .
this happened around christmas .
one of the coal industry 's ads around christmas was this one .
he 's abundant here in america , and he helps our economy grow .
he 's affordable and adorable , and workers keep their pay .
this is the source of much of the coal in west virginia .
the largest mountaintop miner is the head of massey coal .
so the alliance for climate protection has launched two campaigns .
this is one of them , part of one of them .
the fact is , coal isn 't dirty .
we think it 's clean smells good , too .
so don 't worry about climate change .
leave that up to us .
amazing ! the machinery is kind of loud .
america is in crisis the economy , national security , the climate crisis .
the thread that links them all our addiction to carbon based fuels , like dirty coal and foreign oil .
a plan to put america back to work , make us more secure , and help stop global warming .
finally , a solution that 's big enough to solve our problems .
this is the last one .
one of the fastest ways to cut our dependence on old dirty fuels that are killing our planet .
future 's over here . wind , sun , a new energy grid .
new investments to create high paying jobs .
there is an old african proverb that says , if you want to go quickly , go alone .
if you want to go far , go together . 
we need to go far , quickly .
thank you very much .
spatial reasoning is deeply connected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
most importantly , they 're physical , so like the blocks , you can move them just by reaching out and grasping .
so , i 'm going to start with some simple examples .
and these interactive portraits are aware of each other .
so if i put them next to each other , they get interested .
and they can also sense their motion and tilt .
one of the interesting implications on interaction , we started to realize , was that we could use everyday gestures on data , like pouring a color the way we might pour a liquid .
thank you .
so these are some kids that came on a field trip to the media lab , and i managed to get them to try it out , and shoot a video .
they really loved it .
and , one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many instructions .
all you have to say is , make words , and they know exactly what to do .
so here 's another few people trying it out .
that 's our youngest beta tester , down there on the right .
so to him , they were just blocks .
and we wanted to build a learning tool for language learners .
and this is felix , actually .
here , he 's bringing the sun out .
the sun is rising .
now he 's brought a tractor into the scene .
the orange tractor .
good job ! yeah !
hello !
it 's an open ended story , and he gets to decide how it unfolds .
fly away , cat .
each of these has four different variations , you get to choose which one you want to use .
and you can inject these sounds into a sequence that you can assemble into the pattern that you want .
there are effects that you can control live , like reverb and filter .
you attach it to a particular sound and then tilt to adjust it .
and then , overall effects like tempo and volume that apply to the entire sequence .
so let 's have a look .
now i put a bass line in .
now i 'll put some percussion in .
and now i 'll attach the filter to the drums , so i can control the effect live .
i can speed up the whole sequence by tilting the tempo one way or the other .
and now i 'll attach the filter to the bass for some more expression .
i can rearrange the sequence while it plays .
so i don 't have to plan it out in advance , but i can improvise , making it longer or shorter as i go .
thank you .
so , as you can see , my passion is for making new human computer interfaces that are a better match to the ways our brains and bodies work .
and today , i had time to show you one point in this new design space , and a few of the possibilities that we 're working to bring out of the laboratory .
thank you very much .
i look forward to talking with all of you .
when i was , i remember waking up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
my father was listening to bbc news on his small , gray radio .
 the taliban are gone ! my father shouted .
i didn 't know what it meant , but i could see that my father was very , very happy .
 you can go to a real school now , he said .
a morning that i will never forget .
a real school .
you see , i was six when the taliban took over afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
so for the next five years , i dressed as a boy to escort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
it was the only way we both could be educated .
each day , we took a different route so that no one would suspect where we were going .
we would cover our books in grocery bags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
the school was in a house , more than of us packed in one small living room .
it was cozy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
we all knew we were risking our lives the teacher , the students and our parents .
we always wondered what they knew about us .
were we being followed ?
do they know where we live ?
we were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
i was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was prized and daughters were treasured .
my grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
but my educated mother became a teacher .
there she is .
she retired two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
and my father that 's him he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
there was no question that his children would receive an education , including his daughters , despite the taliban , despite the risks .
to him , there was greater risk in not educating his children .
i would want to quit , but my father , he would say , listen , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
your money can be stolen . you can be forced to leave your home during a war .
but the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fees , we will .
so do you still not want to continue ? 
today i am .
i was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
when i returned to afghanistan , my grandfather , the one exiled from his home for daring to educate his daughters , was among the first to congratulate me .
my family believes in me .
i dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
that 's why i am a global ambassador for x , a global campaign to educate women .
the exciting thing is that i see students at my school with ambition grabbing at opportunity .
and i see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , advocate for them , despite and even in the face of daunting opposition .
like ahmed . that 's not his real name , and i cannot show you his face , but ahmed is the father of one of my students .
less than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from sola to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a roadside bomb by minutes .
as he arrived home , the phone rang , a voice warning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
 kill me now , if you wish , he said , but i will not ruin my daughter 's future because of your old and backward ideas . 
what i 've come to realize about afghanistan , and this is something that is often dismissed in the west , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recognizes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
it 's not to say that our mothers aren 't key in our success .
in fact , they 're often the initial and convincing negotiators of a bright future for their daughters , but in the context of a society like in afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
under the taliban , girls who went to school numbered in the hundreds remember , it was illegal .
afghanistan looks so different from here in america .
i find that americans see the fragility in changes .
i fear that these changes will not last much beyond the u .s . troops ' withdrawal .
but when i am back in afghanistan , when i see the students in my school and their parents who advocate for them , who encourage them , i see a promising future and lasting change .
to me , afghanistan is a country of hope and boundless possibilities , and every single day the girls of sola remind me of that .
like me , they are dreaming big .
thank you .
everything i do , and everything i do professionally my life has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in africa .
from to i look young , but i 'm not i worked in zambia , kenya , ivory coast , algeria , somalia , in projects of technical cooperation with african countries .
i worked for an italian ngo , and every single project that we set up in africa failed .
and i was distraught .
i thought , age , that we italians were good people and we were doing good work in africa .
instead , everything we touched we killed .
and of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .
and we were amazed that the local people , in such a fertile valley , would not have any agriculture .
but instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything , we simply said , thank god we 're here . 
 just in the nick of time to save the zambian people from starvation . 
we had these magnificent tomatoes . in italy , a tomato would grow to this size . in zambia , to this size .
 why didn 't you tell us ? you never asked . 
i thought it was only us italians blundering around africa , but then i saw what the americans were doing , what the english were doing , what the french were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , i became quite proud of our project in zambia .
you should see the rubbish you should see the rubbish that we have bestowed on unsuspecting african people .
the book was published in .
i 'm not going to tell you the damage that that money has done .
just go and read her book .
read it from an african woman , the damage that we have done .
the two words come from the latin root pater , which means father . 
but they mean two different things .
paternalistic , i treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children . i love you so much . 
this should be the first principle of aid .
the first principle of aid is respect .
so what you do you shut up .
you never arrive in a community with any ideas , and you sit with the local people .
we don 't work from offices .
we meet at the cafe . we meet at the pub .
we have zero infrastructure .
and what we do , we become friends , and we find out what that person wants to do .
the most important thing is passion .
you can give somebody an idea .
if that person doesn 't want to do it , what are you going to do ?
the passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing .
the passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing .
and then we help them to go and find the knowledge , because nobody in the world can succeed alone .
the person with the idea may not have the knowledge , but the knowledge is available .
let me tell you a secret .
entrepreneurs never come , and they never tell you , in a public meeting , what they want to do with their own money , what opportunity they have identified .
so planning has this blind spot .
the smartest people in your community you don 't even know , because they don 't come to your public meetings .
what we do , we work one on one , and to work one on one , you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn 't exist .
you have to create a new profession .
the profession is the family doctor of enterprise , the family doctor of business , who sits with you in your house , at your kitchen table , at the cafe , and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living .
i was a doing a ph .d . at the time , trying to go away from this patronizing bullshit that we arrive and tell you what to do .
and i helped these five fishermen to work together and get this beautiful tuna not to the cannery in albany for cents a kilo , but we found a way to take the fish for sushi to japan for dollars a kilo , and the farmers came to talk to me , said , hey , you helped them . can you help us ? 
in a year , i had projects going on , and the government came to see me to say , how can you do that ?
how can you do ? and i said , i do something very , very , very difficult .
i shut up , and listen to them . 
so so the government says , do it again . 
we 've done it in communities around the world .
we have helped to start , businesses .
there is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of solitude .
in a community of , people , we get clients .
can you imagine a community of , people , the intelligence and the passion ?
which presentation have you applauded the most this morning ?
local , passionate people . that 's who you have applauded .
so what i 'm saying is that entrepreneurship is where it 's at .
what we have to look at is at how we feed , cure , educate , transport , communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way .
the technologies do not exist to do that .
who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? universities ? forget about it !
government ? forget about it !
it will be entrepreneurs , and they 're doing it now .
there 's a lovely story that i read in a futurist magazine many , many years ago .
there was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of the city of new york in .
and in , this group of people came together , and they all speculated about what would happen to the city of new york in years , and the conclusion was unanimous the city of new york would not exist in years .
why ? because they looked at the curve and said , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the population of new york around , they would have needed six million horses , and the manure created by six million horses would be impossible to deal with .
they were already drowning in manure .
so , they are seeing this dirty technology that is going to choke the life out of new york .
so what happens ? in years ' time , in the year , in the united states of america , there were , car manufacturing companies , .
dearborn , michigan . henry ford .
however , there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
otherwise they don 't come and talk to you .
then you have to offer them absolute , dedicated , passionate service to them .
and then you have to tell them the truth about entrepreneurship .
guess what ?
we have never met a single human being in the world who can make it , sell it and look after the money .
it doesn 't exist .
this person has never been born .
there 's only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common , only one none were started by one person .
never the word i , and the word we times .
he wasn 't alone when he started .
nobody started a company alone . no one .
what can you do ? can you make it ?
okay , can you sell it ? can you look after the money ? 
 oh , no , i cannot do this . would you like me to find you somebody ? 
we activate communities .
thank you .
five years ago , i experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be alice in wonderland .
penn state asked me , a communications teacher , to teach a communications class for engineering students .
and i was scared .
really scared . scared of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big , unfamiliar words .
that 's just how i felt as i had those conversations with the students . i was amazed at the ideas that they had , and i wanted others to experience this wonderland as well .
and i believe the key to opening that door is great communication .
we desperately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tackling our grandest challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don 't know about it and understand it , then the work isn 't done , and i believe it 's our responsibility as non scientists to have these interactions .
but these great conversations can 't occur if our scientists and engineers don 't invite us in to see their wonderland .
so scientists and engineers , please , talk nerdy to us .
i want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is sexy and that your engineering is engaging .
first question to answer for us so what ?
tell us why your science is relevant to us .
sure , you can say spatial and temporal , but why not just say space and time , which is so much more accessible to us ?
instead , as einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simpler .
you can clearly communicate your science without compromising the ideas .
a few things to consider are having examples , stories and analogies . those are ways to engage and excite us about your content .
so i think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonderland that is science and engineering .
and because the engineers that i 've worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner nerd , i want to summarize with an equation .
and so , scientists and engineers , when you 've solved this equation , by all means , talk nerdy to me .
thank you .
hi . this is my mobile phone .
a mobile phone can change your life , and gives you individual freedom .
with a mobile phone , you can shoot a crime against humanity in syria .
with a mobile phone , you can tweet a message and start a protest in egypt .
all this is possible with your mobile phone .
i 'm a child of , and i live in the city of berlin .
let 's go back to that time , to this city .
here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and protested for change .
who in the room has a mobile phone with you ?
hold it up .
hold your phones up , hold your phones up !
hold it up . an android , a blackberry , wow .
that 's a lot . almost everybody today has a mobile phone .
but today i will talk about me and my mobile phone , and how it changed my life .
and i will talk about this .
these are , lines of information .
raw data .
this directive is called data retention directive .
who calls whom ? who sends whom an email ?
who sends whom a text message ?
and if you use your mobile phone , where you are .
all this information is stored for at least six months , up to two years by your phone company or your internet service provider .
and all over europe , people stood up and said , we don 't want this . 
they said , we don 't want this data retention .
we want self determination in the digital age , and we don 't want that phone companies and internet companies have to store all this information about us .
they were lawyers , journalists , priests , they all said we don 't want this . 
and here you can see , like thousands of people went out on the streets of berlin and said , freedom , not fear . 
and i also ask myself , does it really work ?
can they really store all this information about us ?
every time i use my mobile phone ?
and i asked them once , and i asked them again , and i got no real answer . it was only blah blah answers .
so i decided to start a lawsuit against them , because i wanted to have this information .
so at the end , i had a settlement with them .
i 'll put down the lawsuit and they will send me all the information i ask for .
so i got this ugly brown envelope with a c .d . inside .
and on the c .d . , this was on .
thirty five thousand eight hundred thirty lines of information .
at first i saw it , and i said , okay , it 's a huge file . okay .
but then after a while i realized , this is my life .
this is six months of my life , into this file .
so i was a little bit skeptical , what should i do with it ?
because you can see where i am , where i sleep at night , what i am doing .
but then i said , i want to go out with this information .
i want to make them public .
because i want to show the people what does data retention mean .
this is a visualization of six months of my life .
you can zoom in and zoom out , you can wind back and fast forward .
you can see every step i take .
all this is possible with this information .
that 's a little bit scary .
but it is not only about me .
it 's about all of us .
first , it 's only like , i call my wife and she calls me , and we talk to each other a couple of times .
and then there are some friends calling me , and they call each other .
and after a while you are calling you , and you are calling you , and you have this great communication network .
but you can see how your people are communicating with each other , what times they call each other , when they go to bed .
you can see all of this .
you can see the hubs , like who are the leaders in the group .
if you have access to this information , you can see what your society is doing .
if you have access to this information , you can control your society .
this is a blueprint for countries like china and iran .
this is a blueprint how to survey your society , because you know who talks to whom , who sends whom an email , all this is possible if you have access to this information .
and this information is stored for at least six months in europe , up to two years .
the fall of the berlin wall would maybe not have been there .
and in the aftermath , also not the fall of the iron curtain .
because today , state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us , online and offline .
they want to have the possibility to track our lives , and they want to store them for all time .
but self determination and living in the digital age is no contradiction .
but you have to fight for your self determination today .
you have to fight for it every day .
so , when you go home , tell your friends that privacy is a value of the st century , and it 's not outdated .
when you go home , tell your representative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information , they don 't have to do it .
and if you don 't believe me , ask your phone company what information they store about you .
so , in the future , every time you use your mobile phone , let it be a reminder to you that you have to fight for self determination in the digital age .
thank you .
i live in south central .
so the city planners , they get together and they figure they 're going to change the name south central to make it represent something else , so they change it to south los angeles , like this is going to fix what 's really going wrong in the city .
this is south los angeles .
people are dying from curable diseases in south central los angeles .
for instance , the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than , say , beverly hills , which is probably eight , miles away .
i got tired of seeing this happening .
and i was wondering , how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food , if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood ?
and i figured , this has to stop .
food is the problem and food is the solution .
plus i got tired of driving minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn 't impregnated with pesticides .
so what i did , i planted a food forest in front of my house .
it was on a strip of land that we call a parkway .
it 's feet by feet .
thing is , it 's owned by the city .
but you have to maintain it .
so i 'm like , cool . i can do whatever the hell i want , since it 's my responsibility and i gotta maintain it . 
and this is how i decided to maintain it .
and the garden , it was beautiful .
and then somebody complained .
and i 'm like , come on , really ?
and i was like , cool . bring it . 
because this time it wasn 't coming up .
we had a victory on our hands .
i mean , come on , why wouldn 't they ?
that 's central parks .
why in the hell would they not okay this ?
growing one plant will give you , , , seeds .
when one dollar 's worth of green beans will give you dollars ' worth of produce .
growing your own food is like printing your own money .
see , i have a legacy in south central .
i grew up there . i raised my sons there .
see , i 'm an artist .
gardening is my graffiti . i grow my art .
you 'd be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your canvas .
you just couldn 't imagine how amazing a sunflower is and how it affects people .
so what happened ?
i have witnessed my garden become a tool for the education , a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood .
to change the community , you have to change the composition of the soil .
we are the soil .
you 'd be surprised how kids are affected by this .
plus you get strawberries .
i remember this time , there was this mother and a daughter came , it was , like , at night , and they were in my yard , and i came out and they looked so ashamed .
so i 'm like , man , it made me feel bad that they were there , and i told them , you know , you don 't have to do this like this .
this is on the street for a reason .
it made me feel ashamed to see people that were this close to me that were hungry , and this only reinforced why i do this , and people asked me , fin , aren 't you afraid people are going to steal your food ? 
and i 'm like , hell no , i ain 't afraid they 're gonna steal it .
that 's why it 's on the street .
that 's the whole idea .
i want them to take it , but at the same time , i want them to take back their health . 
there 's another time when i put a garden in this homeless shelter in downtown los angeles .
these are the guys , they helped me unload the truck .
it was cool , and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother , and it was just cool to see how this changed them , if it was only for that one moment .
if kids grow kale , kids eat kale .
if they grow tomatoes , they eat tomatoes .
i see young people and they want to work , but they 're in this thing where they 're caught up i see kids of color and they 're just on this track that 's designed for them , that leads them to nowhere .
so with gardening , i see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities , to have a sustainable life .
and when we do this , who knows ?
we might produce the next george washington carver .
but if we don 't change the composition of the soil , we will never do this .
now this is one of my plans . this is what i want to do .
i want to plant a whole block of gardens where people can share in the food in the same block .
i want to take shipping containers and turn them into healthy cafes .
now don 't get me wrong .
the funny thing about sustainability , you have to sustain it .
so what i want to do here , we gotta make this sexy .
we gotta flip the script on what a gangsta is .
if you ain 't a gardener , you ain 't gangsta .
get gangsta with your shovel , okay ?
and let that be your weapon of choice .
so basically , if you want to meet with me , you know , if you want to meet , don 't call me if you want to sit around in cushy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some shit where you talk about doing some shit .
if you want to meet with me , come to the garden with your shovel so we can plant some shit .
peace . thank you .
thank you .
just because it sounds so good .
something to do with words , i assume .
but it 's very important that words are at the center of politics , and all politicians know they have to try and control language .
it 's not . it 's down to a campaigner for the freedom of the press .
but to really show you how words and politics interact , i want to take you back to the united states of america , just after they 'd achieved independence .
and they had to face the question of what to call george washington , their leader .
they didn 't know .
what do you call the leader of a republican country ?
and this was debated in congress for ages and ages .
i mean , some people wanted him to be called chief magistrate washington , and other people , his highness george washington , and other people , protector of the liberties of the people of the united states of america washington .
some people just wanted to call him king .
they thought it was tried and tested .
and , you know , it could have worked .
and everybody got insanely bored , actually , because this debate went on for three weeks .
and the reason for the delay and the boredom was that the house of representatives were against the senate .
they didn 't want to call him king in case that gave him ideas , or his successor ideas .
and that title was president . 
it was like the foreman of the jury .
and that 's why the senate objected to it .
they said , that 's ridiculous , you can 't call him president .
and who 's going to take him seriously if he 's got a silly little title like president of the united states of america ?
and after three weeks of debate , in the end the senate did not cave in .
now you can learn three interesting things from this .
first of all and this is my favorite is that so far as i 've ever been able to find out , the senate has never formally endorsed the title of president .
barack obama , president obama , is there on borrowed time , just waiting for the senate to spring into action .
second thing you can learn is that when a government says that this is a temporary measure you can still be waiting years later .
but the third thing you can learn , and this is the really important one , this is the point i want to leave you on , is that the title , president of the united states of america , doesn 't sound that humble at all these days , does it ?
reality and history have endowed that title with grandeur .
and so the senate won in the end .
they got their title of respectability .
but now , do you know how many nations have a president ?
a hundred and forty seven .
all because they want to sound like the guy who 's got the , nuclear warheads , etc .
and so , in the end , the senate won and the house of representatives lost , because nobody 's going to feel that humble when they 're told that they are now the president of the united states of america .
and that 's the important lesson i think you can take away , and the one i want to leave you with .
politicians try to pick words and use words to shape reality and control reality , but in fact , reality changes words far more than words can ever change reality .
thank you very much .
and this was my first time in afghanistan .
but this is the geography of self .
and where else can the jihadi gangster go , but run for parliament and do a public installation campaign with the slogan vote for me ! i 've done jihad , and i 'm rich . 
i want to look at how , in my opinion , the conflict in afghanistan has become conflict chic .
but doing these things , they can get you in jail , they can be misunderstood , misinterpreted .
but i do them because i have to , because the geography of self mandates it .
that is my burden . what 's yours ?
thank you .
hi . my name is cameron russell , and for the last little while i 've been a model .
actually , for years .
so luckily i brought an outfit change .
if some of the women were really horrified when i came out , you don 't have to tell me now , but i 'll find out later on twitter .
i 'd also note that i 'm quite privileged to be able to transform what you think of me in a very brief seconds .
not everybody gets to do that .
these heels are very uncomfortable , so good thing i wasn 't going to wear them .
the worst part is putting this sweater over my head , because that 's when you 'll all laugh at me , so don 't do anything while it 's over my head .
all right .
so why did i do that ?
that was awkward .
well , hopefully not as awkward as that picture .
image is powerful , but also image is superficial .
i just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
and in this picture , i had actually never had a boyfriend in real life .
so today , for me , being fearless means being honest .
and i am on this stage because i am a model .
i am on this stage because i am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a sexy girl .
and i 'm going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest twist .
so the first question is , how do you become a model ?
and i always just say , oh , i was scouted , but that means nothing .
the real way that i became a model is i won a genetic lottery , and i am the recipient of a legacy , and maybe you 're wondering what is a legacy .
the next question people always ask me is , can i be a model when i grow up ? 
and the first answer is , i don 't know , they don 't put me in charge of that . 
but the second answer , and what i really want to say to these little girls is , why ?
you know ? you can be anything .
if , after this amazing list , they still are like , no , no , cameron , i want to be a model , well then i say , be my boss . 
saying that you want to be a model when you grow up is akin to saying that you want to win the powerball when you grow up .
it will look something like this .
hopefully less awkward than that one in the middle .
that was , i don 't know what happened there .
unfortunately after you 've gone to school , and you have a r sum and you 've done a few jobs , you can 't say anything anymore , so if you say you want to be the president of the united states , but your r sum reads , underwear model years , people give you a funny look .
this picture is the very first picture that i ever took , and it 's also the very first time that i had worn a bikini , and i didn 't even have my period yet .
i know we 're getting personal , but i was a young girl .
this is what i looked like with my grandma just a few months earlier .
my friend got to come with me .
here 's me on the soccer team and in v magazine .
and here 's me today .
and i hope what you 're seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .
okay , so the next question people always ask me is , do you get free stuff ? 
i grew up in cambridge , and one time i went into a store and i forgot my money and they gave me the dress for free .
when i was a teenager , i was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course , we got pulled over , and all it took was a sorry , officer , and we were on our way .
and i got these free things because of how i look , not who i am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are .
and there are only , young black and latino men in new york , so for them , it 's not a question of , will i get stopped ? 
but how many times will i get stopped ? when will i get stopped ? 
when i was researching this talk , i found out that of the year old girls in the united states , percent don 't like their bodies , and that number goes to percent by the time that they 're .
so the last question people ask me is , what is it like to be a model ? 
and when we 're backstage , we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that .
we say , it 's really amazing to travel , and it 's amazing to get to work with creative , inspired , passionate people . 
and those things are true , but they 're only one half of the story , because the thing that we never say on camera , that i have never said on camera , is , i am insecure . 
and i 'm insecure because i have to think about what i look like every day .
so when i was writing this talk , i found it very difficult to strike an honest balance , because on the one hand , i felt very uncomfortable to come out here and say , look i 've received all these benefits from a deck stacked in my favor , and it also felt really uncomfortable to follow that up with , and it doesn 't always make me happy . 
but mostly it was difficult to unpack a legacy of gender and racial oppression when i am one of the biggest beneficiaries .
if there 's a takeaway to this talk , i hope it 's that we all feel more comfortable acknowledging the power of image in our perceived successes and our perceived failures .
thank you .
i have never , ever forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in her exile son , resist gaddafi . fight him .
but don 't you ever turn into a gaddafi like revolutionary . 
and there it was , a great revolution .
young libyan women and men were at the forefront calling for the fall of the regime , raising slogans of freedom , dignity , social justice .
they have shown a great sense of solidarity from the far east to the far west to the south .
eventually , after a period of six months of brutal war and a toll rate of almost , dead , we managed to liberate our country and to topple the tyrant .
i met a very difficult environment in the pre elections , an environment which was increasingly polarized , an environment which was shaped by the selfish politics of dominance and exclusion .
eventually , our initiative was adopted and successful .
women won . percent of the national congress in the first elections ever in years .
however , bit by bit , the euphoria of the elections , and of the revolution as a whole , was fading out for every day we were waking up to the news of violence .
on another day we wake up to the news of the assassination of army officers .
our society , shaped by a revolutionary mindset , became more polarized and has driven away from the ideals and the principles freedom , dignity , social justice that we first held .
intolerance , exclusion and revenge became the icons of the aftermath of the revolution .
i am here today not at all to inspire you with our success story of the zipper list and the elections .
i 'm rather here today to confess that we as a nation took the wrong choice , made the wrong decision .
we did not prioritize right .
for elections did not bring peace and stability and security in libya .
no , it didn 't .
what is it , then ?
our society needs the qualitative representation of the feminine more than it needs the numerical , quantitative representation of the feminine .
we need to start acting as agents of compassion and mercy .
that 's the real zipper .
according to a quranic verse salam peace is the word of the all merciful god , raheem . 
and so just as the womb entirely envelopes the embryo , which grows within it , the divine matrix of compassion nourishes the entire existence .
thus we are told that my mercy encompasses all things . 
thus we are told that my mercy takes precedence over my anger . 
may we all be granted a grace of mercy .
thank you .
when i was little , i thought my country was the best on the planet , and i grew up singing a song called nothing to envy . 
and i was very proud .
although i often wondered about the outside world , i thought i would spend my entire life in north korea , until everything suddenly changed .
when i was seven years old , i saw my first public execution , but i thought my life in north korea was normal .
my family was not poor , and myself , i had never experienced hunger .
but one day , in , my mom brought home a letter from a coworker 's sister .
it read , when you read this , all five family members will not exist in this world , because we haven 't eaten for the past two weeks .
we are lying on the floor together , and our bodies are so weak we are ready to die . 
i was so shocked .
this was the first time i heard that people in my country were suffering .
soon after , when i was walking past a train station , i saw something terrible that i can 't erase from my memory .
but nobody helped them , because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families .
a huge famine hit north korea in the mid s .
ultimately , more than a million north koreans died during the famine , and many only survived by eating grass , bugs and tree bark .
i always wondered why they had lights but we didn 't .
this is a satellite picture showing north korea at night compared to neighbors .
but many die .
sometimes , i saw dead bodies floating down the river .
i can 't reveal many details about how i left north korea , but i only can say that during the ugly years of the famine i was sent to china to live with distant relatives .
but i only thought that i would be separated from my family for a short time .
i could have never imagined that it would take years to live together .
in china , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .
one day , my worst nightmare came true , when i was caught by the chinese police and brought to the police station for interrogation .
i was so scared , i thought my heart was going to explode .
i thought my life was over , but i managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions .
after they finished questioning me , one official said to another , this was a false report .
and they let me go . it was a miracle .
these girls were so lucky .
even though they were caught , they were eventually released after heavy international pressure .
it 's tragic that north koreans have to hide their identities and struggle so hard just to survive .
even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned upside down in an instant .
that 's why , after years of hiding my identity , i decided to risk going to south korea , and i started a new life yet again .
settling down in south korea was a lot more challenging than i had expected .
english was so important in south korea , so i had to start learning my third language .
also , i realized there was a wide gap between north and south .
we are all korean , but inside , we have become very different due to years of division .
i even went through an identity crisis .
where am i from ? who am i ?
suddenly , there was no country i could proudly call my own .
even though adjusting to life in south korea was not easy , i made a plan .
i started studying for the university entrance exam .
just as i was starting to get used to my new life , i received a shocking phone call .
they had to get out quickly , so i started planning how to help them escape .
north koreans have to travel incredible distances on the path to freedom .
since my family couldn 't speak chinese , i had to guide them , somehow , through more than , miles in china and then into southeast asia .
the journey by bus took one week , and we were almost caught several times .
one time , our bus was stopped and boarded by a chinese police officer .
he took everyone 's i .d . cards , and he started asking them questions .
since my family couldn 't understand chinese , i thought my family was going to be arrested .
he looked at me suspiciously , but luckily he believed me .
after i paid the fine and bribe , my family was released in one month , but soon after , my family was arrested and jailed again in the capital of laos .
this was one of the lowest points in my life .
i lost all hope .
at that moment , i heard one man 's voice ask me , what 's wrong ? 
i was so surprised that a total stranger cared enough to ask .
i thanked him with all my heart , and i asked him , why are you helping me ? 
 i 'm not helping you , he said .
i realized that this was a symbolic moment in my life .
eventually , after our long journey , my family and i were reunited in south korea , but getting to freedom is only half the battle .
many north koreans are separated from their families , and when they arrive in a new country , they start with little or no money .
we can also act as a bridge between the people inside north korea and the outside world , because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside , and we send information and money that is helping to change north korea from inside .
i 'm confident that you will see more and more north koreans succeeding all over the world , including the ted stage .
thank you .
today i have just one request .
please don 't tell me i 'm normal .
now i 'd like to introduce you to my brothers .
remi is , tall and very handsome .
remi knows what love is .
he shares it unconditionally and he shares it regardless .
he 's not greedy . he doesn 't see skin color .
he doesn 't care about religious differences , and get this he has never told a lie .
when he sings songs from our childhood , attempting words that not even i could remember , he reminds me of one thing how little we know about the mind , and how wonderful the unknown must be .
samuel is . he 's tall . he 's very handsome .
don 't they sound incredible ?
but most people don 't agree .
and in fact , because their minds don 't fit into society 's version of normal , they 're often bypassed and misunderstood .
but what lifted my heart and strengthened my soul was that even though this was the case , although they were not seen as ordinary , this could only mean one thing that they were extraordinary autistic and extraordinary .
now , for you who may be less familiar with the term autism , it 's a complex brain disorder that affects social communication , learning and sometimes physical skills .
it manifests in each individual differently , hence why remi is so different from sam .
and across the world , every minutes , one new person is diagnosed with autism , and although it 's one of the fastest growing developmental disorders in the world , there is no known cause or cure .
and i cannot remember the first moment i encountered autism , but i cannot recall a day without it .
i was just three years old when my brother came along , and i was so excited that i had a new being in my life .
and after a few months went by , i realized that he was different .
he screamed a lot .
he didn 't want to play like the other babies did , and in fact , he didn 't seem very interested in me whatsoever .
and as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .
extraordinary .
now , i cannot deny that there have been some challenging moments in my family , moments where i 've wished that they were just like me .
but i cast my mind back to the things that they 've taught me about individuality and communication and love , and i realize that these are things that i wouldn 't want to change with normality .
normality overlooks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn 't mean that one of us is wrong .
it just means that there 's a different kind of right .
and if i could communicate just one thing to remi and to sam and to you , it would be that you don 't have to be normal .
you can be extraordinary .
because autistic or not , the differences that we have we 've got a gift ! everyone 's got a gift inside of us , and in all honesty , the pursuit of normality is the ultimate sacrifice of potential .
the chance for greatness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
please don 't tell me i 'm normal .
thank you .
but now , years later , we can go a million times faster and see the world not at a million , or a billion , but one trillion frames per second .
now , if you take that bullet and take this packet of photons and fire into this bottle , how will those photons shatter into this bottle ?
how does light look in slow motion ?
now , the whole event
but , coca cola did not sponsor this research .
now , there 's a lot going on in this movie , so let me break this down and show you what 's going on .
some of the light leaks , goes on the table , and you start seeing these ripples of waves .
many of the photons eventually reach the cap and then they explode in various directions .
meanwhile , the ripples are traveling on the table , and because of the reflections at the top , you see at the back of the bottle , after several frames , the reflections are focused .
now , if you take an ordinary bullet and let it go the same distance and slow down the video again by a factor of billion , do you know how long you 'll have to sit here to watch that movie ?
a day , a week ? actually , a whole year .
it 'll be a very boring movie of a slow , ordinary bullet in motion .
and what about some still life photography ?
you can watch the ripples again washing over the table , the tomato and the wall in the back .
it 's like throwing a stone in a pond of water .
so how did my team at mit create this camera ?
and we can take all that raw data and treat it in very interesting ways .
so , superman can fly .
some other heroes can become invisible , but what about a new power for a future superhero to see around corners ?
the idea is that we could shine some light on the door .
and it 's not science fiction . we have actually built it .
there 's a mannequin hidden behind a wall , and we 're going to bounce light off the door .
so after our paper was published in nature communications , it was highlighted by nature .com , and they created this animation .
and this way , we know the distances , of course to the door , but also to the hidden objects , but we don 't know which point corresponds to which distance .
can we see it in full d ?
so this is our reconstruction .
but there 's also something funny going on here .
when you look at the ripples under the cap , the ripples are moving away from us .
the ripples should be moving towards us .
what 's going on here ?
it turns out , because we 're recording nearly at the speed of light , we have strange effects , and einstein would have loved to see this picture .
the order at which events take place in the world appear in the camera with sometimes reversed order , so by applying the corresponding space and time warp , we can correct for this distortion .
it 's about time . thank you .
there are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
we don 't bump into every neighbor , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
so over the past few years , i 've tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like stickers , stencils and chalk .
and these projects came from questions i had , like , how much are my neighbors paying for their apartments ?
how can we lend and borrow more things without knocking on each other 's doors at a bad time ?
how can we share more of our memories of our abandoned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
and how can we share more of our hopes for our vacant storefronts , so our communities can reflect our needs and dreams today ?
now , i live in new orleans , and i am in love with new orleans .
the city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world , but it also has one of the highest amounts of abandoned properties in america .
in , i lost someone i loved very much .
her name was joan , and she was a mother to me , and her death was sudden and unexpected .
and i thought about death a lot , and this made me feel deep gratitude for the time i 've had , and brought clarity to the things that are meaningful to my life now .
but i struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life .
i feel like it 's easy to get caught up in the day to day , and forget what really matters to you .
i didn 't know what to expect from this experiment , but by the next day , the wall was entirely filled out , and it kept growing .
and i 'd like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall .
 before i die , i want to be tried for piracy . 
 before i die , i want to sing for millions . 
 before i die , i want to plant a tree . 
 before i die , i want to hold her one more time . 
 before i die , i want to be someone 's cavalry . 
 before i die , i want to be completely myself . 
it 's about knowing you 're not alone .
it 's about understanding our neighbors in new and enlightening ways .
i made this last year , and started receiving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civic center colleagues and i made a tool kit , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including kazakhstan , south africa , australia , argentina and beyond .
together , we 've shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we 're given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another .
two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
in our age of increasing distractions , it 's more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is brief and tender .
death is something that we 're often discouraged to talk about or even think about , but i 've realized that preparing for death is one of the most empowering things you can do .
thinking about death clarifies your life .
our shared spaces can better reflect what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our hopes , fears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
thank you .
thank you .
so , well , i do applied math , and this is a peculiar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management consultants .
no one knows what the hell we do .
so i am going to give you some attempt today to try and explain to you what i do .
so , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
now , ballet requires an extraordinary level of expertise and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initial suitability that may well have a genetic component to it .
so great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
however , there are . million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with incurable weakness , tremor , rigidity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are objective tools to detect the disease before it 's too late .
you have to go to the clinic to do it . it 's very , very costly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it 's just never done . it 's never done .
but what if patients could do this test at home ?
now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clinic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
no expensive staff time required .
takes about , by the way , in the neurologist 's clinic to do it .
and like ballet , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
i mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
we see all the same symptoms .
so these voice based tests , how do they stack up against expert clinical tests ? we 'll , they 're both non invasive .
the neurologist 's test is non invasive . they both use existing infrastructure .
you don 't have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
that means they can be self administered .
they 're high speed , take about seconds at most .
they 're ultra low cost , and we all know what happens .
when something becomes ultra low cost , it becomes massively scalable .
so here are some amazing goals that i think we can deal with now .
we can reduce logistical difficulties with patients .
we can do high frequency monitoring to get objective data .
we have the opportunity to start to search for the early biomarkers of the disease before it 's too late .
so , taking the first steps towards this today , we 're launching the parkinson 's voice initiative .
anyone healthy or with parkinson 's can call in , cheaply , and leave recordings , a few cents each , and i 'm really happy to announce that we 've already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
thank you .
so max , by taking all these samples of , let 's say , , people , you 'll be able to tell who 's healthy and who 's not ?
what are you going to get out of those samples ?
you see , some people may not do it . they may not get through it .
but we 'll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it 's getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ironing out the confounding factors , and looking for the actual markers of the disease .
so you 're percent accurate right now ?
it 's much better than that .
ninety nine . well , that 's an improvement .
so what that means is that people will be able to people will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with parkinson 's could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they 're doing in this course of the disease .
absolutely .
thanks so much . max little , everybody .
thanks , tom .
this is where i live . i live in kenya , at the south parts of the nairobi national park .
those are my dad 's cows at the back , and behind the cows , that 's the nairobi national park .
so predators like lions follow them , and this is what they do .
they kill our livestock .
this is one of the cows which was killed at night , and i just woke up in the morning and i found it dead , and i felt so bad , because it was the only bull we had .
my community , the maasai , we believe that we came from heaven with all our animals and all the land for herding them , and that 's why we value them so much .
so i grew up hating lions so much .
so they kill the lions .
it 's one of the six lions which were killed in nairobi .
and i think this is why the nairobi national park lions are few .
so a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad 's cows , and that 's the same thing which happened to me .
so i had to find a way of solving this problem .
and the first idea i got was to use fire , because i thought lions were scared of fire .
but i came to realize that that didn 't really help , because it was even helping the lions to see through the cowshed .
so i didn 't give up . i continued .
and a second idea i got was to use a scarecrow .
i was trying to trick the lions into thinking that i was standing near the cowshed .
but lions are very clever .
they will come the first day and they see the scarecrow , and they go back , but the second day , they 'll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it 's always here .
so he jumps in and kills the animals .
and i discovered that lions are afraid of a moving light .
so i had an idea .
since i was a small boy , i used to work in my room for the whole day , and i even took apart my mom 's new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but i learned a lot about electronics .
and i got a switch where i can switch on the lights , on and off .
and that 's a small torch from a broken flashlight .
so i set up everything .
as you can see , the bulbs face outside , because that 's where the lions come from .
and that 's how it looks to lions when they come at night .
the lights flash and trick the lions into thinking i was walking around the cowshed , but i was sleeping in my bed .
thanks .
so i set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with lions .
and my neighboring homes heard about this idea .
one of them was this grandmother .
she had a lot of her animals being killed by lions , and she asked me if i could put the lights for her .
and i said , yes . 
and my idea is also being used now all over kenya for scaring other predators like hyenas , leopards , and it 's also being used to scare elephants away from people 's farms .
my new school now is coming in and helping by fundraising and creating an awareness .
i even took my friends back to my community , and we 're installing the lights to the homes which don 't have any , and i 'm teaching them how to put them .
so one year ago , i was just a boy in the savanna grassland herding my father 's cows , and i used to see planes flying over , and i told myself that one day , i 'll be there inside .
and here i am today .
i used to hate lions , but now because my invention is saving my father 's cows and the lions , we are able to stay with the lions without any conflict .
ash ol n . it means in my language , thank you very much .
you have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like yours .
so you got this scholarship . yep .
you 're working on other electrical inventions .
what 's the next one on your list ?
my next invention is , i want to make an electric fence . electric fence ?
but i know electric fences are already invented , but i want to make mine .
you already tried it once , right , and you i tried it before , but i stopped because it gave me a shock .
we 're going to cheer you on every step of the way , my friend .
thank you so much . thank you .
photography has been my passion ever since i was old enough to pick up a camera , but today i want to share with you the most treasured photos of mine , and i didn 't take any of them .
my story begins when i was in new york city for a speaking engagement , and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday . we 're on the corner of th and th .
we happened to be back in new york exactly a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
well you can see where this is going .
this is when we started asking passing tourists to take the picture .
you know , it 's remarkable how universal the gesture is of handing your camera to a total stranger .
back then , we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives .
it 's really become sacred to us .
this one was taken just weeks after , and i found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a five year old could understand .
they 're also ways for us to freeze time for one week in october and reflect on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physically , but in every way .
because while we take the same photo , our perspectives change , and she reaches new milestones , and i get to see life through her eyes , and how she interacts with and sees everything .
this very focused time we get to spend together is something we cherish and anticipate the entire year .
and she describes to me the feeling she felt as a five year old standing in that exact spot .
she said she remembers her heart bursting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier .
and now what she 's looking at in new york are colleges , because she 's determined to go to school in new york .
and it hit me one of the most important things we all make are memories .
so i want to share the idea of taking an active role in consciously creating memories .
i don 't know about you , but aside from these shots , i 'm not in many of the family photos .
i 'm always the one taking the picture .
so i want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot , and don 't hesitate to go up to someone and ask , will you take our picture ? 
thank you .
